<P>	Knowledge shall NOT, finally, know the knower.  Psychology knows otherwise; Freud
told them so!!  The vast majority of psychologists agree with Freud, possibly without knowing
their debt to him or their agreement with him.  Foucault (the current holder of the Chair of The
History and Systems of Thought, College De France) in his analysis of Freud concludes: no one in
the human sciences (psychology is at times part of this array) is out of his debt.  Thus everyone
(so holding in psychology) is linked with the paradox which surrounds Freud.  Freud the giant; the
first major theorist to break with the Classical Age's enforced silence on madness; Freud the first
to systematically listen to madness; Freud the first not to condemn madness into silence; the first
to pronounce that in interchange with the knower, the knower can be known; silenced this very
knower in the rescue.  Freud opened up (Foucault lets us see) a discourse with difference
(madness), spoke to/with difference as his theory allowed him to speak, and ordered that
difference within which is every person; part of the thought of all, and part of all which is thought. 
It is that wide hand which Freud had; a further reason for the appropriateness of Foucault's
suggestion: 'no one is out of his debt.'  The paradox, of course, is that rescue brought silence,
robbed the knower of the very possibility of knowing <U>as</U> knower (the internal paradox: that the
interdict from the Vedas-is immediately confirmed by the denier: by Freud) as a double
reductionism was offered by Freud: biological and theoretical.  The illogic of reductionism, as
knowledge, has not fully entered the marrow of psychological claims (be they 'models,'
'paradigms,' or displacements).  Freud killed the possibility of the authority of the knower
knowing, as only via 'biology' and Freud's theory can one know.  Thus the hoax (which generally
goes unnoticed), of the claim that via psychotherapy/analytics (or whatever contemporary or
ancient paraphrase) 'one' can know oneself.  </P>

<P>	But suppose: 'one' is zero.  The argot which allows primacy to the 'one of one'
relationship has totally swallowed Freud.  Let me give an FDA caveat to this ingestion.  This
mongrel claim (see: the ordinary language philosophers) that an account of 'psychotherapeutic'
interchange is 'one on one,' reveals hope dragged out as knowledge (remember Mr. Dawson's
quoting Koch on this bit of legerdemain).  One careful account (impossible for Freud the
reductionist) of the exchange termed therapy is: 'One on zero.'  (This phrase emerged in one of
my lectures.)  The 'zero' is you, me, everyone, or that part of everyperson ('just that part' Freud
was after) which is different; that which in the Classical Age (as Foucault has demonstrated)
wasn't there (remember G. Stein 'On Oakland'); and which in the Modern age was locked into
'existence' by the Modern episteme.  That very presence, the knower, radicalized (as we now say)
the episteme, signaled (among other facets) the Modern episteme's total break with the Classical
discourse (hence the sleight of hand comparisons of Kuhn and Foucault).  The knower
(Foucault's MAN-an expanded definition of that critical term in a moment) is authorized in the
Modern age as inalienable authority, along with and separate from the authority of science.  The
knower, called forth in the break with the discourse of the Classical age, saw as his legend the
demise of a single authority, namely; the word.  Representation was the calendar of the Classical
age.  The 'word knew.'</P>

<P>	Take the word 'medicine.'  In the classical age (Foucault allows us to notice)
seeing/saying are still one fundamental level of language.  'Bile pied up in the body,' 'blood had
become impoverished, thickened'; what was said (e.g. re: Bile, re: Blood) and what was 'there'
are united in a manner totally unlike the medical dialog of the modern age.  (Certainly there are
remnants in the Modern age: e.g. the doctor/patient encounter//relationship; seen by Foucault as
re-emergence via 'the pale powers of matrimonial fantasies'...'to so much non-thought.'  The
verbal performance (a critical term for Foucault) for the physician of the classical age was: 'What
is the matter with you?'  For the physician of the Modern age the query changed to: 'Where does
it hurt?'  In the Modern age verbal performance and object have the kind of independence which
for example Wittgenstein gave it in his post-Tractatus work.  In Freud, the gaze brings its own
constant light: see the Oedipus complex.</P>

<P>	'One on Zero' (though admittedly coined by me as a quick reply to student alliteration)
seems to tell the mark about 'psychotherapy.'  Szasz has spoke about the Myth of Psychotherapy,
and has kept that article's title for a forthcoming book.  Szasz seems to be moving from his earlier
Ryleian position to a Wittgensteinian one when <U>he</U> terms psychotherapy as independent, both of
the psyche and of therapy, but replete as: conversation.  Szasz, in his efforts to clarify
psychological claims uses the work of the Ordinary Language Philosophers, Mill, and Laissez-faire economics.  In Szasz's use of this trilogy, the unifying force is: 'To let be.'  The 'let be'
notion is the double integral of the Ordinary Language Philosophy view.  'Things
(word/sentence/object) are what they are.'  'Value lies outside of the world' (of factual
knowledge).  The second (and smaller integral) is that of: clarification.  Freud too insists on
clarification, and Wittgenstein is therefore often compared to Freud.  Wittgenstein too speaks of
sickness (re language) seeming for some to (further) cement a bridge to Freud.  Their common
ground is language, though the announced similarity is vitiated by Freud's concern with 'thought,'
with reductionism, with prior causes, with continuity, with teleology, with theory, etc.  Two great
men touching fingers for a second is the most I dare venture.</P>

<P>	Nothing in the ordinary language philosophies, Mill, and/or laissez-faire economics seems
capable of rescue of psychotherapy (now understood as 'conversation').  The 'let be' injunction,
and that is precisely what 'psychotherapy' can NOT advocate, fits institutional practice no more
than it fits private practice.  Thus, Szasz's distinction between institutional practice/private
practice seems strained (while important because of the obvious differences in control of human
beings // see: psychology's most famous animal trainer, B. F. Skinner).  If psychotherapy is
remaindered to 'conversation,' private practice is voided.  If Szasz leaves conversation to
professionals, he stands among Benda's traitorous clerks.  To license (as in
psychiatry/psychology) conversation seems to violate basic precepts of our founding documents
(free speech/derived powers), and to do exactly what Foucault sees happening; namely kill MAN.</P>

<P>	In search of a designation of psychotherapy (other than the attractive one of conversation)
one can offer what Dr. Ralph has offered for 'psychology in application,' namely: litany, police
practice, fraud, chauvinism.  All of the aforementioned can be taught (professors have no
fear-your courses are safe), can be tested for, can form curricula.  If the Classical age is your
forte, if robbing of language is your joy, if the guarantees of our founding documents are but a
nuisance, by all means write about and practice psychotherapy.  Please notice that while Foucault
allows psychoanalysis to be ordered under 'knowledge,' he excludes it as science.  So there you
are, with your christian science, as Dr. Ralph suggested.  That too (christian science) can be
learned, can be taught, is wanted-so what!  Is it enough to use your office, your affiliation to
rationalize your sound?  Remember Mr. Dawson, psychology is NOT what psychologists Do! 
Howler, yes-sense, No!</P>

<P>	Allow me to take another turn, to make you look at the monumental travesty: psychology
speaking as MAN.  The turn is the work of Foucault.  Unlike Santayana's famous quote Foucault
directs us to 'archeology;' as he claims to be doing neither History nor Philosophy.  The
touchpoint between the two men is that without clarification of the penumbra of the discourse
(used here in a general/not Foucaultian sense) what is said/is, remains unclear.  Archeology is the
technique through which Foucault ferrets out the 'unconscious' of discourse (not to be confused
with the unconscious of Freud-though there is a touchpoint as well), allowing the user (insert
psychology) to see 'for the first time' (T. S. Elliot) the full of the verbal performance (insert
psychological claim/statement).  Archeology allows one to notice just what it is that is/must be
said and can be said in no other way (archeology is not a substitute for the empirical-does not
generate empirical knowledge).</P>

<P>	In the absence of archeological clarification (in our case) the psychologist will verbally
perform without the consciousness that what is given (verbally performed) is given precisely
because 'that and only that' can be voiced in that particular discourse.  The telling point: an end to
will, choice, solipsism, phenomenology; an end to <U>a priori</U> causes; an end to hidden meanings.  No
room for the 'good heart' (of the individual clinician-except as nonsense), no room for the 'I
won't cop out-power to the people' claim of the therapist; no room for virginal consciousness
raising; no room for entering therapy as sex; no room for 'the family' as the unity of therapy; no
room for 'the marriage' as counsel; for <U>the</U> 'governing' confines <U>are</U> the parameters of the
discourse.</P>

<P>	(An aside: This is one of the points in common between Kuhn and Foucault; the other
significant similarity is the total break between epistemes/paradigms.  Dialog across epistemes is
not possible, nor is it possible to mix dialogs within epistemes.  Kuhn, of course, has no
'archeology,' and therefore a Kuhnian analysis is not interchangeable with a Foucaultian analysis
of discourse.)</P>

<P>	To the remark that 'really Foucault is just using Freud's unconscious' (whether that
remark is used as rescue of therapy, or as ignorance) let me reply: that Foucault's unconscious
unlike Freud's unconscious, is neither theory, nor vector, nor force, nor teleology but ambience of
discourse.   A parallel to Foucault's unconscious is Wittgenstein's rule/meaning/object.</P>

<P>	Foucault argues: ...A moment would come when, from animality (the girding conception
of 'madness' in the Classical age) would be deduced the idea of mechanistic psychology ...where
the blindness (of madness) became the psychological effect of a moral fault; AND thereby
comprises what had been (in the Classical age) essential in the experience of unreason.  What had
been blindness would become unconsciousness, what had been error would become fault, and
everything in madness that designated the paradoxical manifestation of non-being would become
the natural punishment of a moral evil.  In short, that whole vertical hierarchy which constituted
the structure of Classical madness, from the cycle of material causes to the transcendence of
delirium, would now collapse and spread over the surface of a domain which psychology and
morality would soon occupy together and contest with each other.   ...The "scientific
psychiatry/psychology as MAN" of the nineteenth century became possible. ...It was in these
"diseases of the nerves" and in these 'hysterias,' which would soon provoke its irony, that this
psychiatry/psychology took its origin.</P>

<P>	(An aside: To drop the medical model is to drop 'nothing' since medicine was never a
founding condition of the discourse (psychiatry/psychology as MAN).  The putative rescue of
to/as psychology (via the removal of the medical model) is but fraud and ignorance.  Szasz,
generally credited with being the high priest of this error (voiding of the medical model and by
return: the rescue of "clinical psychology"), has actually avoided this pitfall by being a
Ryleian/Million/Laissez-faire economist, and recently by depicting 'psychotherapy' as
conversation.)</P>

<P>	To continue with the archeology of Psychology as MAN.  Foucault allows that: ...the
nineteenth century, by investing the famous "moral methods," has brought madness and its cure
into the domain of guilt.  The distinction between the physical and the moral becomes a practical
concept in the medicine of the mind ONLY when the problematics of madness shifts to a
interrogation of the subject responsible.  The purely moral space, which is then defined, gives the
exact measurements of that psychological inwardness where modern man seeks both his depth and
his truth...Psychology, as a means of curing, is henceforth organized around punishment...A
purely psychological medicine (of course neither medicine nor psychology) was made possible
only when madness was alienated in guilt...  In the Classical period, it is futile to try to distinguish
physical therapeutics from psychological medications, for the simple reason that psychology did
not exist.  When the consumption of bitters was prescribed, for example, it was <U>not</U> a question of
physical treatment, since it was the soul as well as the body that was to be scoured...  When, in
the years that followed, this great experience of unreason, whose unity is characteristic of the
Classical period, was dissociated, when madness, entirely confined within a moral intuition, was
nothing more than disease, then the distinction we have just established assumed another meaning;
what had belonged to disease pertained to the organic, and what had belonged to unreason, to the
transcendence of its discourse, was relegated to the psychological.  And it is precisely here that
psychology was born-NOT as the truth of madness, but as a sign that madness was henceforth
nothing but a phenomenon adrift, insignificant upon the undefined surface of nature ...An enigma
without any truth EXCEPT THAT WHICH COULD REDUCE IT (rise Freud-rise you saviors in
psychological drag).</P>

<P>	Psychology is born.  Thus, in the modern world, what had been the great irreparable
confrontation of reason and unreason <U>became</U> the secret thrust of instincts against the solidity of
the family institution and against its most archaic symbols.  Foucault lets us see that the language
of Freud took over a foundation of silence rationalized around transgression.  He states: ...When
Freud, in psychoanalysis, cautiously reinstitutes exchange, henceforth eroded into monologue
(remember my 'one on zero'), should we be astonished that the formulations he hears are always
those of transgression?  In this inveterate silence, transgression has taken over the very sources of
speech.  (See the demise of, e.g., 1<SUP>st</SUP> amendment guarantees, as well as the demise of the authority
of the individual: the basis of all power in a free society.)</P>

<P>	Foucault continues ...Freed from the chains that made it a purely observed object, madness
lost, paradoxically, the essence of its liberty, which was solitary exaltation... ...an ordinary police
tribunal sat permanently (vis-a-vis the patient) ...the doctor (read psychologist) is not there (vis-a-vis the patient) by virtue of a medical skill or power that he possesses in himself and that would be
justified by a body of objective knowledge.  It is not as a scientist that <U>homo medicus</U> (read
psychologist) has authority. ...If the medical profession (psychology) is required, it is as a juridical
and moral guarantee, NOT in the name of science.</P>

<P>	...the essential nucleus of madness ...was a microcosm in which were symbolized the
massive structure of bourgeois society and values.  (An aside: discourse/praxis is NOT to be
understood via the much used term "ideology."  Foucault rejects this effort, on similar grounds on
which Wittgenstein rejects 'values' as an explication of 'words/sentences' or earlier: of
propositions/simples.  What is/is (for Wittgenstein and similarly for Foucault) the world 'is what
is,' and all value lies outside of it; what's more what is/is accidental (thus into
metaphysics/nonsense go: purposes, meanings, will and such accounts as ideology.  Warning: do
not confuse the 'archeological' inclusion of bourgeois ideology (as forming discourse) with
'ideology' as explicator of discourse.  Foucault's persistent (and Wittgensteinian) derision of
'ideology' is of ideology as explicator of discourse.  (Further aside: The term ideology seems to
vie with Kuhn's paradigm for inexplicability.)</P>

<P>	To continue with Foucault's analysis: ...the authority he (the psychiatrist/psychologist) has
borrowed from order, morality, and the family <U>now</U> seems to derive from himself (remember:
psychology is NOT what psychologists do) ...the objectivity (of psychiatric/psychological praxis)
was from the start a reification of a magical nature... ...accomplished with the complicity of the
patient...beginning from a transparent and clear moral practice, gradually forgotten in its origins
and its meaning, ...soon madness itself would be held responsible for such anomalies...  (what was
offered then was) ...cures without basis, which must be recognized as not being false cures... but
as true cures of FALSE ILLNESSES.</P>

<P>	For Foucault MAN is: to think again what has been thought/verbally performed-thus
essentially empirico-and also transcendental; to think again, while rooted in what is available-the
time and space, the setting, the surround: for Foucault, Life, Labor, Language.  What the modern
episteme authorized for the first time in Western history was the finitude of each moment as
thought/said by MAN.  MAN is that ...living being who, from within the life to which he entirely
belongs, and by which he is traversed in his whole being, constitutes representations by means of
which he lives, and on the basis of which he possesses that strange capacity of being able to
represent to himself precisely that life ...who provides himself with a representation of language
itself.</P>

<P>	Unlike psychology's conventional depictions, Foucault works out in devastating detail
that: MAN can <U>not</U> be understood as: (borrowing from biology) ...possessing functions-receiving
stimuli (physiological ones, but also social, interhuman, and cultural ones, reacting to them,
adapting himself, evolving, submitting to the demands of an environment, coming to terms with
the modification it imposes, seeking to erase imbalance, acting in accordance with regularities,
having in short, conditions of existence and the possibility of finding average norms of adjustment
which permit him to perform his functions   ...All this Foucault argues is but an appearance on the
projected surface of biology: thus a double reductionism to biologism/scientism.  Foucault allows
us to see that on the projected surface of economics (another reductionism) MAN <U>APPEARS</U> as
having needs, desires, as seeking to satisfy them, and therefore as having interests, desiring
profits, entering into opposition with other men; in short he appears in an irreducible situation of
conflict.  Foucault thru his archaeological analysis brings us (psychology) face to face with Ghosts
(Ibsen behold) out of which we (psychology) pretend substance.</P>

<P>	(An aside: the decades of work on 'reductionism' have seemingly not entered our
(psychology's) analytics.)</P>

<P>	Foucault continues: ...(on the projected surface of economic) MAN is depicted as if he
evades these conflicts, he escapes from them or succeeds in dominating them, in finding a solution
that will-on one level at least, and for a time-appease their contradictions; he establishes a body
of rules which are both a limitation of the conflict and a result of it.</P>

<P>	...on the projected surface of language (another reductionism), man's behavior appears as
an attempt to say something; his slightest gestures, even their involuntary mechanisms and their
failures, have a meaning; and everything he arranges around him by way of objects, rites, customs,
discourse, all the traces he leaves behind him, constitute a coherent whole and a system of signs.</P>

<P>	(An aside: what now of the various schools/views of psychology?  What now, given the
archeological explication of Foucault, of 'what we know psychology to be'?  How is it that
psychological efforts to speak of MAN, and more devastating, to speak as MAN, fall outside of
science; and even (as Foucault allows) as psychological verbal performance falls within
knowledge, that knowledge falls outside of the Modern discourse, the very discourse which gave
it birth, which allowed it to emerge as 'proper verbal performance'?)</P>

<P>	Reply: For Foucault it is not simply a matter of reductionism, of scientism, or of
reification, but it <U>is</U> because psychological discourse of/as MAN fails to meet the requirements of
science in the Modern episteme, as well as the requirements of science in the Classical episteme. 
To restate: Psychological discourse (of/as MAN) is neither science now nor was it science
then-even if psychology (as science) had existed in the Classical age-the usage we now have as
psychology does not meet the standards of science of the Classical age.  Psychology today does
however imitate the philosophical statements of the 18<SUP>th</SUP> Century.</P>

<P>	Further: as knowledge (which Foucault allows to psychology 'of Man,' as he does to the
other Human Sciences), psychology can <U>not</U> speak 'as MAN'; since only Man (each individual)
can speak 'as MAN.'  The Finitude (which is MAN) prevents even that individual from restating
what had been stated (shades of Gertrude Stein, of Wittgenstein, of Derrida).  Remember again,
that the authority which 'issued' MAN allowed that speaker an inviolability, an inalienable status. 
An obvious tie (here) to the vesting to each and every person those 'self evident truths' and
'powers' to which the state is subordinate and only derivative-an obvious tie to the cornerstones
of our founding documents.  No wonder that Psychology is seen as the <U>least</U> liberal of the 'human
sciences,' and psychologists as the first among totalitarians.</P>

<P>	Let me touch on another related critical question.  Why is the progress in the science of
psychology so slow?  Foucault's reply is that: neither the 'complexity of man' (a common hiding
place for the admitted lack of progress in psychology); nor the misuse of statistics and of design
(another conventional criticism used to rationalize the admitted lack of progress in psychology);
nor the absence of adequately refined mathematics (an oft expressed lament-Foucault offers
superb detail of the rush into mathesis-as error); none of these have kept psychology in arrears;
nor have they kept the mound of scientific knowledge in psychology to a child's sandcastle.  What
retards psychology is its attempts to speak of/as MAN.  (Wittgenstein has long ago offered a
similar account.)  Clearly (given Foucault/Wittgenstein) a radical reordering of what is psychology
is long overdue.</P>

<P>	Since MAN is not of psychology, what is left?  Macro-neurology?  Macro-Cybernetics? 
Macro-Linguistics?  This question nettles; and the best that I have been able to offer to date is:
chronology (episodic/continuous).  This 'chronology' would be a step different from literature;
but if Wittgenstein holds, this chronology could say/depth grammar: nothing.</P>

<P>	What future does Foucault see for MAN?  Given the ascending authority of Science, of
the so called Human Sciences, of the State; given the nod to psychology-Foucault suggests that
MAN will ...be erased like a face drawn in the sand at the edge of the sea.</P>

<P>	For those interested in the guarantees of the founding documents of our nation, that would
indeed be "beyond freedom and dignity."</P>

<P>	I have attempted to sketch for you Foucault's arguments: 1.  That neither science nor
psychology can speak of/as MAN; 2.  That the human sciences (those parts of psychology,
linguistics, sociology, ethnology, et al, which attempt to speak of/as MAN are not science, but
imitation of the philosophical discourse of the 18<SUP>th</SUP> century, and 3.  That the standard explanations
for the lack of progress of the science of psychology are delusion.  I am suggesting that to speak
of/as MAN is to violate the guarantees of our founding documents: the guarantee of equality
(which I read as the inviolability of differences), and the guarantee that power to govern (e.g.
speak) rests solely in the people (which I read: in the individual).  Since a professed aim of
psychology is to draw man into science, into nomotheticness, thus into sameness, a collision
course has existed ever since that aim was enunciated at the birth of psychology.  The
archaeological analysis of Foucault has exposed the double folly of that aim.</P>

<P>	For those of you who would push aside Foucault, to rescue psychology (whatever that is): 
let me alert you to another older combat, Wittgenstein.  Wittgenstein takes man (the language
user) out of nature-thus out of the grasp of science.  He eliminates, as factual discourse, any part
of psychology involving language usage.  Wrestle with that.  You might try it on the mat of
promise, with Fodor, or on the sketch pad with Quine.</P>

<P>	An invitation.  Foucault will be a Distinguished Visiting Scholar on our campus during the
week of October 17-join us in a dialog with him.  Let me leave you then, with the beginning.</P>

<P>	Knowledge shall not, finally, know the knower.  And, add to that: whatever Psychology is,
MAN is not a part of it.</P>
