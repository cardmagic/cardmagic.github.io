<P>	The tradition out of which I am speaking is old and ignored.</P>

<P>	The dialog I am trying to revive and sharpen is filed in the history of our professional
organizations.  It is recorded there in a composition quite unlike the character which I give it.</P>

<P>	From the outset a dialog in American Associations of Psychology has been whether to
include or exclude the applied segment of our discipline and that argument is still current (and for
me wrongly conceived) as evidenced by a recent series of articles in the <U>American Psychologist</U>. 
We are again being asked whether two types of organization of psychologists (the error is in
speaking and thinking of both as psychologists); Scientific and Professional might better serve
both camps.</P>

<P>	From my perspective, an early CORRECT conception of applied (or professional)
psychology (and to a degree of theoretical psychology) came from the authorities in the Soviet
Union, when they banned Sigmund Freud's writings and his conception of practice.  They saw
clearly (and correctly) that they were not dealing with science (in the so-called application of
science and to a degree in the analytic part of science)-but with politics.</P>

<P>	An equally clear and correct perception much earlier in our Western history was the vision
of the Pope and former friend of Galileo, who through his office of the Faith had the inquisition
silence Galileo, in the clear and correct recognition that even abstract science involves a view of
the human condition and thus values.  The discipline which has become most startled by the
differences between theory and application is of course physics.  Physics through the development
of the bomb, and use of the bomb discovered the value component (in varying degrees present) in
the conception, construction, and use of energy.  Clinical and other applied psychologies, as well
as psychiatry, seem totally incapable of noting the fit of the experience of physics.  Totally, of
course, allows for the major exception of Thomas Szasz, his followers, and the few others who
think in like manner.</P>

<P>	In the explosion (allowed by theory, research, and technology) public policy was created
and furthered.  Examination was ended, a truth was offered (a truth which falsified physics and
public policy) and physics ceased to exist (at that moment) as a discipline, and became social
engineering.  Or, as Julian Benda would have it, they became traitorous Clerks.  Clerks, who
because of the betrayal of reason TO public policy betrayed both their clerkship (we would now
say their academic role) and citizenship.  Betrayal since physics and public policy are confused
into each other, and thus both are falsified.  When a physicist sits in the council of advisors and
speaks toward a public policy he has lost his role as a physicist, has beguiled the argument by
suggesting that physics as physics can speak in social council.</P>

<P>	When the industrial psychologist enters the gate of industry, he is locked into the
efficiency, work, and profit model (and thus a view of the human condition), and no series of
caveats will rescue his offerings to science.  And importantly (for the clarification which I am
attempting) also will it not rescue industry-he is thus a lie to both.  When the psychologist sets
out in (and later offers up to public authorities) his research on integration, he fails to notice that
he has changed the definition of citizenship from a constitutional guarantee to a psychological
guarantee.  Suppose, e.g., that psychological research had established the benefits of segregation,
what then-the issue is still a Constitutional and Bill of Rights one and does not require
psychological research.  The psychologist further fails in his notice, by not seeing that his work is
essentially political, and of course anti-libertarian as have been almost all of the efforts in the
clinical and social psychological domain.  And just as "of course" when absorbed into public
policy there is absolutely nothing psychological about these efforts.  To use the current notion-the
field has been reconstituted.  </P>

<P>	The full and final exposure of Pinel, Tuck, Rush, and that covey (by Foucault and Szasz) 
has done for clinical psychology what the bomb has done for physics.</P>

<P>	Yet, we still seem unable to notice.  And to notice that the advent of technology changes
(and has changed) the conception of the human condition.  The mechanics model, the repairability
notion, allow the notion <STRONG>failure</STRONG>.  Citizenship (as seen in the Bill of Rights, e.g.) do not allow
these conceptualizations of the human condition, and offers instead the notion man.  We see then,
in technology and next in clinical psychology, an obliteration of the abstraction man into technics. 
As clinical psychology (psychiatry) took one of its further leaps of ignorance by speaking of
Community Psychiatry, and made the world its patient, man as a unit of abstraction further
disappeared, even the nation state (whose minions applied workers clearly are) was put into
question and world-wide fascism dressed up as health service became beloved-and all this before
1984.  What an advanced group we are.  Or, put it another way, not bad for a young bunch of
hoods.  What do you think would happen if these traitorous clerks had the age of physics coupled
with its technology at their disposal?  The misreading of their status by applied workers is only
limited by imagination.  Some further examples: The code of ethics and certification/licensing. 
That proud effort, the ethics manual, is of course not a scientific document, but moral stricture
which fits not inquiry but conduct, and makes of applied workers what they are (so in a sense it is
relevant) decorum preservers.  For whom?  The public good.  How arrived at?  Which public? 
The rush to certification/licensing is but another chapter of the wedding state and practice.  Oh
yes, it is argued as insurance for standards.  In the light of what scientific knowledge?  Then in
what light is it argued?  A few voices opposed this nationwide rush for certificate from big
brother.  And most of these voices failed to note a profound issue while speaking to it.  The issue
(here) is not (as has been argued) "will the state dictate practice?" but rather "will the certified
practice further the dictates of the state?"</P>

<P>	The service orientation of so-called psychologists has variously blown them into the arms
of the state as expert witness.  What can they witness to?  Out of what is their witness?  The vast
failure of becoming current with the logical analysis of the early and middle part of this century is
not a minor criticism of a discipline which prides itself of its scientific sophistication, and
(deliberately linked at this juncture in my exposition because of its double comment) prides itself
of its liberalism.</P>

<P>	Out of what is the witness?  Does the psychological-psychiatric expert offer a new set of
facts?  As does, e.g., the chemist, the pathologist, the ballisticist, or does he merely comment on
the behavior in question?  If he comments only (ascribes), then out of what is the ascription of the
testifying psychologist?  Out of everyday folk value, out of the reigning (or in opposition to it)
value of the day.  He either moralized to or against, e.g., "insanity."  As if insanity were a
fact-this is what I mean when I say that the said psychologist is <STRONG>not</STRONG> in his sophistication in the
20<SUP>th</SUP> Century, but dutifully disguising moralism as science (which of course is not logically
possible).  And the jurisdictions (courts, hospitals, prisons) welcome him, and he at times cites
them for their inhumanity, <STRONG>when</STRONG> his very actions have destroyed the notion man into the
conception state as referent for conduct.  This of course (the diabolic here) is a "humanistic, man
oriented" discipline.  A science, of course, can easily operate without the later values.</P>

<P>	Pinel, applied psychology's most prominent anti-liberal, chained man into compliance by
invoking the conception (of the human condition) termed: "responsibility" for conduct.  He did
this against the former conceptions of the human condition as demonic, humoral, possessed, and
of a (simply) general human condition.  Pinel's "personal responsibility morality" was a double
thin veil which helped the demise of the then hardly emerging notion of a man as citizen, <STRONG>as</STRONG>
responsibility was state defined, and reminded by example (lock you up for crazy man), reminded
by example that for conduct the unity of reference must be the license of the state (the power
elite).  The ancient antagonisms to statute which one sees in religion (and thus in part religion
furthered the definition man) is decreased by the so-called psychologicalization of man.  So-called
because it has nothing to do with psychology, but everything to do with statism.</P>

<P>	The psychological expert speaking on issues other than said insanity comes to the court
with citations.  What is he citing?  Out of what conceptions arise his citations?  To what are his
citations relevant?  Are his findings, we need to ask again, like the findings of the, e.g., chemist? 
There similarities (as you know some in contemporary philosophy argue that there are NO
similarities, that psychology <STRONG>can not</STRONG> be a science, that man is not part of nature), but when
offered as testimony the findings of psychology become moralism, politics.  (Notice the dialog on
drug abuse, alcoholism, suicide, and the like.)  Testimony is not Science but advocacy-clearly so
when it is ascription (as with insanity, sexuality, and the like), less clearly so when additional facts
are present, as with the e.g., chemist, pathologist, and so on.  The Soviet authorities and the Pope
wanted testimony and were correct in seeing it as political-moral.  It is not necessary to the logic
of the argument (which I am presenting) though helpful as illustration to notice that the said
psychologist's preponderance of testimony is about drug abuse, alcohol intake, suicide, sex
practices, and insanity.  The mounting of the witness box serves my argument with a further ease,
the drawing of the line between being and not being a psychologist.  The end of the psychologist
and the beginning of the politicist is at the transom of testimony.  This is where analysis ends,
advocacy begins, and the shading of values eclipse the analytic-experimental.  Implicit, and allow
the repetition, is the recognition that "pure" science is bound in some degree by values, offers also
conceptions of the human condition (see: drives, needs, homeostasis, nature-nurture, vicissitude,
intervening variables, etc.), but the degree of value present is a critical factor (another being the
grammar of the statement) in the formulation and the use of the formulation (see: Russell, Ryle,
Wittgenstein, Benda, etc.).  The as yet poorly incorporated logical analysis of this century is
critical, and helpful to us in noting when we are clerks, and when traitors, or "pure" in offering a
look (see Galileo), exposing in that look Religion as Religion (and thus not as Truth), and
therefore the upset and alertness of the popes.</P>

<P>	My charge is: that Psychology is doing the reverse today, it is confusing public policy as
psychology.  And thereby not allowing public policy to be seen for what it is.  Thus the
appropriateness of Benda's charge-treasonous clerks-traitors to psychology, to public policy, but
not to the pope.</P>

<P>	I think that admonition of Karl Marx about the writing of history can be applied in a large
measure to psychology: Psychology can be viewed as the writing of politics.	</P>
