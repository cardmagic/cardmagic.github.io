<P>	"Knowledge shall NOT, finally, know the knower."  This interdict from the Vedas links
Wittgenstein and Foucault (Michel Foucault is Professor and holder of the Chair of History and
Systems of Thought at the College of France).  Let me attempt to sketch the profound affinity of
these two scholars, and note that the serious differences which also exist do not vitiate the bond. 
The profound tie between Wittgenstein and Foucault is the silence/illusion/limits each imposes on
language/discourse.  Foucault calls himself a diagnostician of 'discourse.'  Foucault asserts that he
is doing neither History nor Philosophy, and as does Wittgenstein holds that the examination he
has invented (archeology) leaves the empirical untouched.  Archeological analysis exposes the
unconscious of discourse; not to be confused with the unconscious of Freud, though similarities
do exist.  Archeological analysis maintains a variety of guidelines developed by Wittgenstein, and
imposes additional ones, some of which do no violence to the Wittgensteinian view.</P>

<P>	Psycho-logic is not a metric of archeology, neither is anthropo-logic.  Phenomono-logic,
scepticism, and solipcisms are relegated out of Foucault's analytics.  The 'exterior/interior'
dichotomy is resolved in the Wittgensteinian manner.  The 'private language' argument is seen in
a similar sense.  The 'boundary' argument is a critical feature of the archeology.  The logical/use
limits of word (sentence) is honored, and is used as a limit for discourse, for the 'statement', and
for the 'enunciative field' as well as for other features of discourse.  The arguments about
'universals' apply to Foucault's account of discourse and epistemes.  A mixture of discourses
voids both discourses.  A discourse may arise in an episteme whose rules it mimics, but does not
reflect, and while that discourse may be termed knowledge, it may not be entitled to the claim of
scientificity (see: Psychoanalysis).  Reduction, in the form of application, metaphor, and
scientification, is (at minimum) a 'boundary error' resulting in the destruction of discourse. 
Discourse 'is what it is,' and while Foucault is tempted to posit a theory about discourse, the
formulations that: hidden, transcendental, primary, causative events located on yet another plane
(than the discourse in question) is rejected.  What is said/is what is said, and can only be so said in
that discourse, set in that episteme.  To those still fond of ideologies (as clarifiers of discourse)
Foucault gives little comfort.  Archeological analysis can not rescue ideology out of metaphysics.</P>

<P>	The 'family resemblance' issue is met/used in the dramatics of the total break between
epistemes.  (The word 'medicine' in the classic age has similarity to the word 'medicine' in the
modern age only by virtue of: sound and spelling.  The words: madness, grammar, economics,
Natural history, et al, also have only sound and spelling in common from episteme to episteme.) 
The discourse of an episteme is not at the option of an individual.  However, a specific and limited
option is found in the notion MAN.  To speak of/to/about discourses (or elements thereof) is a
feature of 'verbal performance' which Foucault calls MAN.  The 'birth' of this contention seems
to be the splitting of the authorization of verbal performance among: science/state/individual
speaker, and is allied to a humanism.  This 'individualized' verbal performance remains within the
'empirico' and 'is' 'transcendental' only by virtue of comment/authority.  Only with the abrupt
end of the Classical discourse, and the independent emergence of the Modern discourse could the
notion MAN occur.  Of course, Man could occur as an 'individual verbal performance' at any
time in the history of homo sapiens, but not as 'epistemic verbal performance' (notice: Heresy).</P>

<P>	Foucault suggests that the anthropocentrism in which Wittgenstein is at times shrouded, is
possible only in the Modern age.  Wittgenstein's time, as one sometimes hears, would be for
Foucault not Vienna, but the Modern episteme.  There is, however, no implication that
Wittgenstein's methodology is inappropriate for the analysis of ordinary language of another
episteme; just as Foucault's archeological analysis is not restricted to the Modern age, or to
science.</P>

<P>	Time and space are not confiners of MAN, notice here the similarity to that aspect of the
'rule/meaning/grammar' dialog.  Wittgenstein's 'rule' is honored,, and used for the entire
discourse.  An 'independence of meaning' finds no place in Foucault.  Foucault's 'verbal
performance' is (as with Wittgenstein's 'usage') the key to objects, but the word 'objects' of the
Modern age is unlike that word of the Classical age.  In the Classical age, object and word/object
are peculiarly involved.  Archeological analysis in different 'ages' must yield varying
ontological/epistemological claims.</P>

<P>	The various implicits of the 'forms of life' argument can be seen in Foucault's discussion
of discourse, and in his caveats about epistemes.  Foucault through his archeological analysis
attempts to expose the 'given' in discourse.  The unconscious of discourse is laid open, again not
to expose a secret source, a hidden meaning, but to clarify "...what has to be accepted, the given
is-so one could say-<U>forms of life</U>" (P.I. 226).  The 'verbal performance' 'is an is'.  Discourse 'is'
a form of life, as it forms by its 'posivity' and by its exclusion.  Foucault lays open the
noninductive conditions justifying the 'verbal performance' of a discourse, and in that gives notice
of the influence of 'criteria' on his work.  He does not make a contribution to the unworked out
arguments about criteria.  As suggested earlier, the unexaminability of MAN rests partially on the
'criteria' and 'forms of life' arguments.</P>

<P>	Silence: Foucault's 'verbal performance' and his account of knowledge differ from what is
'sayable/grammar'.  Epistemic structures enforce their own particular silence.  Involved in this
inevitability (epistemic silences) are the in situ political/moral structures.  Foucault's silence is
more 'sayable' than Wittgenstein's, but only at the 'exterior limits' of MAN.  Here (exterior
limits) what for Wittgenstein would be surface grammar (illusion) becomes for Foucault
'knowledge/representation'.  Silence holds over all attempts (including Freud's) of speaking 'as
MAN'.</P>

<P>	Can science be the metric for discourse?  No!  Foucault (must and does) argue that
archeology is not science.  His argument involves the clarity offered in/about sentences/grammar. 
Neither Wittgenstein's man, nor Foucault's Man 'are part of nature', and therefore the
clarification man/MAN is not a scientific question, and not a question at all. 
Quantification/mathematics offer no rescue; of silence, of man/MAN; nor does mathematics
scientialize (see: Psychology).  232 of the PI is a full part of Foucault's position.</P>

<P>	Psychology is questioned: Foucault notes the sorry state of clinical psychology; speaks
less pejoratively of Fechner's efforts (as long as those efforts are not glorified because of the use
of logarithms); and speaks of decision theory, and of learning.  No psychological effort, (whether
termed knowledge and/or science) can, of course, speak 'as MAN'.  If psychological findings are
based (partially or fully) on language, Wittgenstein's dicta would offer these claims the rest of
silence/illusion.  If philosophy of mind is to rescue psychological inquiry/findings, then
Wittgenstein must be refuted.  If this refutation rests on promissory notes, it can only stand as
promise, and not as refutation.  If Wittgenstein's challenge of psychology is questioned because of
its 'extreme' position, the questioner must demonstrate that the challenge of Wittgenstein is not
simply founded in political conservatism, and/or a reading of the history of science.</P>

<P>	Aside: Some psychological findings could be allowed as-chronology.  This might not
satisfy many in psychology, as chronology (continuous or episodic) would fall outside of science;
but not necessarily outside of factual language.  This chronology could also remain within what
Wittgenstein has termed: 'what I have not said/shown'.  That unsaid/unshown was held by
Wittgenstein to be what is most important in life.  The part of Wittgenstein's criticism of Freud
which is tribute, is the telling that Freud has shown us something important-of that which is of
importance in life.</P>

<P>	The "Human sciences" (Foucault states) are: those times, of Sociology, of Literature, of
Ethnology, of Linguistics, of Psychology, et al, during which these disciplines assert to be
speaking 'as MAN'.  The human sciences are exposed (via archeological analysis) as <U>not</U> being
sciences at all, even while they are revealed to be possible (and only possible) as
discourse/knowledge in the Modern age.  Paradox: The human sciences, possible only in the
Modern age wherever there is: analysis of 'norm', 'rules', and 'signifying totalities', use the verbal
performance style of the Classical age.  Aside: This alone would not preclude their scientificness. 
Classical discourse (which excluded the verbal performance called MAN), plus the isomorphism
of object/MAN (MAN whose 'birth: is the very possibility of the human sciences), plus the
involution on representation, these combined conditions exclude the human sciences from being
science; and allows the characterization of the human sciences as imitating the philosophical
posture of the 18<SUP>th</SUP> century.  The human sciences can, therefore, only 'represent' MAN.  While
Foucault enables us to see that no one of the human sciences is out of Freud's debt (Freud: the
setter of the 'outside limits' of discourse set to speak 'as MAN'), Foucault also reveals that Freud
is the champion of a double error.  Error one: To herald the scientizability of man.  Error Two:
To suggest a clarification of MAN using an epistemic style in which that very conception/activity
(MAN) is not possible.  Foucault lets us see that the diabolic of Freud is the affinity of Freud (thus
of all the human sciences) to the Modern age, while engaged in a complete rupture with the
Modern episteme.  For Foucault, Freud was that genius who understood (along with Nietzsche)
the role of death as limit in verbal performance; who understood, that if the finite is to be
validated (which of course Freud immediately violated: via a twofold reductionism-</P>

<P>Biology and theory), the range of verbal performance must be extended.  Foucault shows how
Freud the rescuer of the irrational, validated the irrational as 'the mirror' (see Foucault: on Sade),
which immediately became common glitter.  Using Foucault's terms, Freud's effort to rescue the
<U>Other</U>, ended up by superimposing the <U>Same</U>.  Foucault shows how a rescue effort becomes its
counter while honoring Freud as pioneer ('No one in the human sciences is out of his debt'),
Foucault lets us see that MAN paid the price by disappearing into Freud: an ironic price for
rescue.  Freud's Herculean failure is applauded by Foucault and Wittgenstein, as it is exposed.</P>

<P>	Foucault warns us that MAN (the end of the empirico-transcendental axis-that inalienable
authority to speak) is in danger.  The rise of science (another independent authorized voice), the
status of human sciences, both may eclipse that inalienable authority.  If that authority is vacated
by political or epistemic change, then "...MAN would be erased, like a face drawn in sand at the
edge of the sea."</P>

<P>	The methodological style of Foucault seems to have profited from the work (mostly post
Tractatus) of Wittgenstein.  To the question: Is Wittgenstein's mode of clarification of ordinary
language continued in the archeological effort of Foucault-a resounding yes can be offered. 
Critical features of Wittgenstein's analytics can be found in Foucault's account of verbal
performance; an account while unique to Foucault, while brought to analysis by Foucault, while
hardly interchangeable with Wittgenstein's own efforts, seems to warrant the suggestion of an
impact of Wittgenstein of Foucault.</P>

<P>	Future papers need to focus on the details of the disparity between and similarities of these
two scholars, highlighted in this brief survey.  Comparisons always run the risk of reductionism,
and of absurdity; hopefully the case here made avoided these pitfalls.</P>

<P>	Two giants, on similar and different grounds, have given credence to an Eastern wisdom: 
Knowledge shall not, finally, know the knower.</P>
