<P ALIGN="CENTER">Proposal (1985/86)</P>

<P>	For over twenty years (as each of his writings became available) I have been using the
radical analytics of M. Foucault to assist my students in examining the 'truth status' of
psychological claims about: 'human nature'/'self-individuality'/'abnormality'/'sexuality'; and to
assist them in obtaining a perspective about the: "psychological examination" of human beings.</P>

<P>	Foucault's unexpected death at the age of 57 (on 6/7/84) rekindled my desire to put into
book form a view of Foucault I have found useful in my teaching.</P>

<P>	I propose to collect these ideas of Foucault under the title: "Three Horsemen of Liberty: 
Foucault/Szasz/Wittgenstein."</P>

<P>	Recent (1984) interviews and the coming release of two more volumes (of a formerly
projected five volume work) of his "History of Sexuality" will be integrated with material from his
previously published books, articles and interviews.</P>

<P>	I will draw on techniques of presentation I have developed and found successful in
teaching: rework them and add to them other examples from our current society to assist students
to come to the analytics of Foucault.  I have been using 'Affirmative action' as a note on
'silence/freedom' and have found it useful in helping students understand the 'silence/freedom' of
Foucault.  I plan to re-work the current paradigms of liberation movements (Female/Gay) so that
the new paradigms can become vehicles of the understanding of 'silence/freedom' as used by
Foucault.</P>

<P>	My publications (both national and international) on Foucault/Wittgenstein and on the
inherent antagonism to diversity in nomothesis/if nomothesis is to guide (as it does guide)
psychological prescription will be re-examined.</P>

<P>	A bevy of books have recently appeared on/about Foucault.  A leave would allow me to
bring back to my students/university the thinking of various scholars along with my (re)
considered views on the major critic (since L. Wittgenstein) of psychological claims: M. Foucault.</P>

<P>	The traditional charge to the University to 'examine' is even more urgent when the State
empowers Psychology to speak about human beings.  Our students (to a degree) live in the 'Age
of Psychology,' they must be able to examine their age.  The aim of my work is to assist them in
this examination.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Wittgenstein (W), the apolitical, leaves to the speaker a power over/in language denied the
speaker uncritically taught to use normative discourse of the nation state/daily life.  W not only
allowed one to 'see the world aright,' but also anew, be it in the 'shown' or in 'grammar.'  Rorty <A HREF="#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>
sees W as being able to umbrella the 'abnormal' (in language) as well as the normative, as W's
strictures of forms of life/language games (fl/lg) deny dominance of any one fl/lg is the
'conversations of mankind.'  Rorty holds up W (along with Dewey/Heidegger) as philosophers
without mirrors.</P>

<P>	W warned Freud not to confuse his claims as hypothesis<A HREF="#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> and by extension warns about all
that is of Freud in contemporary discourses on person.  The power over words/sentences given by
W are taken away by Freud in Freud becoming the litmus to truth.  No hierarchy of truths is
suggested by W either in the earlier or the later work.  Metaphysics is not scorned, only
clarified/credited.</P>

<P>	The wisdom of W that 'everything is as it is' would be one studied reply to those who
alarm: suppose we allowed....  The 'we allowed' of course immediately gives away the
disenfranchisement of each and every speaker speaking outside of a preferred fl/lg.  W'ian notions
of incommensurateness of fl/lg are (here) not heeded.  Further, so called 'clear and present
dangers' are seen as conditions of a particular fl/lg and not as incendiary to human communities. 
As stated, W's gift to freedom of speech/belief did not come from a political doctrine he held, but
are embedded in his efforts to clarify words/sentences.  Fealty to any one normative discourse is
not a W'ian demand-it is police power.  Freud thought otherwise and inadvertently served the
nation state/daily life in controlling the speaker/the mute.</P>

<P>	Freud allowed (though he was hardly needed for this) for the person living in the modern
nation state to be termed 'troublesome'; allowed for an examination of that person; an
examination which is but metaphoric to the examination in the sciences, while said to be
interchangeable with it.  For Freud the unconscious behind words/feelings became the
'experimental ground' to comprehend language.  Freud ignored the W'ian caveat to 'look and
see' and thus failed to become clear about the limits of any one fl/lg.  Freud by locating the well of
trouble in the person was blinded thereby from seeing it to be in language-Freud remained
impervious to W's warning.</P>

<P>	Freud developed a rationale by which the modern state can label a person as with; hidden
forces/antagonistic to the weal of the nation state; unwilling to heed the truth about
themselves/willing to subvert that truth.  W gave no such permit to the nation state.  Instead the
work of W speaks of diversity in among fl/lg; gives to no one fl/lg dominance/preferred access to
'truths;' provides clarity about the limits of fl/lg/varying grammars-and thus (I am arguing) sets a
freedom seldom offered.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Michel Foucault (F) considered the major problem of the 19<SUP>th</SUP> and 20<SUP>th</SUP> centuries to be
POWER, power over language.  Clearly, F belongs in the pages of Rorty's work in a presence
much larger than Rorty allowed, since a central effort of F was to note the impossibility of
'mirror'----all the while systematically examining the reflections positioned in language-images
which reduce the power to speak.  The quest for 'human nature' (the most mirror of all mirrors in
the study of man) is thought to 'dissolve man'; using here the concern expressed by Levi-Strauss
when the latter spoke of 'ethnology', F holds:</P>

<P>	...thus we see the destiny of man being spun before our very eyes, but being spun
backwards; it is being led back, by those strange bobbins to the forms of its birth, to the
homeland that made it possible.  And is that not one way of bringing about its end?  For
linguistics no more speaks of man himself than do psychoanalysis and ethnology.<A HREF="#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	F took W's warning to Freud seriously.</P>

<P>	F speaks of his work on the Prison<A HREF="#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> as the first of five projected volumes studying power
over person through a truth form local only to the 10th/20th centuries: a bio/power/knowledge
(b/p/k).  This form of knowledge is nation state endorsed/norm generating/cast in the grammar of
biological sciences/part of the speech of daily life and flirtatious about its curative and discovery
power.  Daily life is the concern of b/p/k, as pseudo mirror is its lens.</P>

<P>	The projected volumes of Sex (three completed before his death) are used by F to
demonstrate that the b/p/k form, while pretending to
anatomy/biology/endocrinology/psychological trauma is not an example of these disciplines (of
their grammar); but are a hidden call to similarity dressed in the smirky promise of/true
enjoyment/true knowledge/true sex-as 'doctor knows best.'</P>

<P>	F is careful to avoid conspiracy notions; reminds us that we speak in a language not of our
doing/into which we were born; however, he insists that "...we can be freer than we think'<A HREF="#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> thus
fitting into Rorty's 'edifying discourse.'  While Rorty suggests a needed privileged status to move
to abnormal speech, F holds it open to anyone/at any time.</P>

<P>	In a lecture at California State University, Sacramento<A HREF="#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A> F puzzled the expression 'self'
pointing out that alien to its radical the term self is situated in the normative nation state
discourse/daily life assertions, suggesting a move away from abnormality; thus hardly the radical
of individuality.</P>

<P>	Unconnected moments is another signal feature of F'ian analytics.  F, too, holds that ...a
rose, is a rose, is a rose.  The moment of speaking (sex is another moment for F) is a signal truth
for F, but if used by the speaker to characterize the speaker/then that moment of speaking falls to
'essence'/no longer moment/no longer a discontinuity, but (now) history (continuous).  Given that
context the spoken 'resembles' in the sense in which W'ian games resemble-the closer look (and
see) demanded by W was carried out by F: 'self'/'sex' become chimera.</P>

<P>	F'ian freedom is to be found in/via language; not through
constitutions/institutions/political forms.  Unlike Hamlet, the election lights on the speaker.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	"I don't talk about myself that way," T. S. Szasz (S) told one of his questioners after a
formal address at California State University, Sacramento<A HREF="#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A>.  The question (the student thought it
was a question) posed to S was; "Aren't you Jewish?"  The student was dumbfounded by S's
retort, shook his head and drifted away.  S turned to me and smiled asking: "Do you think he got
what I was trying to show him?"</P>

<P>	Over more than three decades in well over 385 publications<A HREF="#N_9_"><SUP>(9)</SUP></A> S has allowed the lay and
professional communities to examine the word 'insane' and allied related terms.  In S's
examination of the use/place of psychiatric power he clarifies the similarities within the Soviet and
Western psychiatry by noting that in both instances the power to speak and to maintain the sense
of claims is given by the nation state to psychiatrists-and taken away from the individual, in a
ritual termed psychiatric examination.  Following Sartre S asks: Who defines/who is defined?</P>

<P>	S who ties his views to the social contract notions of J. S. Mill, the clarifications of Ryle,
Sartre and W lets it be known that to misuse language is a kind of murder-a murder of
reason/equality/clarity.  Speaking within a social contract convention S uses the notion 'will' and
in that differs sharply from both W and from F.  Responsibility is an important term for S and
along with his minute examination of the word 'insanity' has led him to ask for the abolition of the
insanity plea.  S holds up schizophrenia<A HREF="#N_10_"><SUP>(10)</SUP></A> as but the sacred symbol of psychiatry, which
(knowingly) to the formulators of that term involved the taking away of freedom of speech and of
movement.  He notes that the genetic and biological formulations of 'psychiatric ills' are but a
pseudo-biology.</P>

<P>	S is not against contractual psychiatric treatment as he is a free market economist, but the
imprimatur of the nation state would be denied the 'mental health worker' and the tie to medicine
would be ended, leaving the 'psychiatrist' to compete freely with: bartenders, taxi drivers and
other advise mongers.</P>

<P>	S sees human relations to be at base adversarial/contractual.  Psychotherapy is
reformulated by S as essentially: rhetoric, repression and religion.  The two people who contract
to explore along these lines are viewed as co-equal, with the professional leading in reflecting the
claims about living raised by the contractor against the ancient wisdoms recorded in the annals of
tragedy/comedy.  Careful attention is paid to the use/misuse of words/sentences.  For S the
freedom to speak/think is a torch constantly endangered by the winds of the misuse of language
(see S's agreement with K. Kraus<A HREF="#N_11_"><SUP>(11)</SUP></A>).</P>

<P>	S forces attention to the 'if' in the claims made about the conditions of living.  S holds
that: 'if' liberty, 'if' freedom, 'if' justice for all, 'if' the power to speak without veto be returned
to the speaker then the corruption of language/morals/commitment inherent in (S maintains)
psychiatric falsification of language must end.  Other 'ifs' would, of course lead into other
directions of living.  In his book Ceremonial Chemistry<A HREF="#N_12_"><SUP>(12)</SUP></A>, which includes a five thousand year
history of drug usage, S captures the lies about drugs/addiction.  He concludes that the addictive
quality of the drug is in the language not in the chemical and by drawing a careful distinction
between physiological learning and addiction, and by turning the question of addiction into the
right of ingestion; he puts into question all the laws regulating 'recreational drugs.'</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The three horsemen ride through words/sentences offering a shield against some of 20<SUP>th</SUP>
century truth forms/ancient divisions of homo sapiens; as well as against transparency/reduction,
be it from science or from pseudo science.  In their reigns 'who speaks' gallops us to
language/speaker.  The election lights on you; to speak/be silent-a gift without strings. </P>
