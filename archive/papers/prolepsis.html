<h2>Abstract</h2></div>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific significance or meaning of an event might better be understood in the context
of the <U>outcome</U> to which it led--the future into which one is drawn is important knowledge to
have in order to understand the significance of the past.  Yet psychologists use <U>past</U> determinants
or present contemporaneous circumstances to contingently predict subsequent events.  This paper
argues that better predictions might be made by understanding the significance of an act in the
context of where it fits into the future--that is, if one assumes that instead of being propelled by
discrete events of the past, one is drawn into a meaningful future.  Prolepsis is conceptually
associated with postdictive, <U>ad hoc</U> and <U>ex post facto</U> explanation.  Implications of this argument
change the conception of being human from an agent upon which events act, to an agent which is
dynamically changing and evolving as one is drawn into the realization of the future.  The non-volitional pull of the future in understanding past significances may be more informative than past
events observed in contingent relationships to subsequent occurrences.  Such contextual
imbeddedness of understanding is consistent with post-modern consciousness.  The assumption of
temporally isolated non-contingent occurrences as having regular predictable outcomes robs
human action of the context of meaning and thus our human understanding of the meaning of
human action.</div><br><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The later "ordinary language" philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein<A HREF="#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> argued that rather than
language being representational whereby a word or concept <U>signifies</U> or "stands for" an "object" of
reality, the meaning of a word is derived from its actual <U>uses</U> in accordance with tacit rules within
the language-using community.  Meaning therefore heavily rests upon the context of the use of
language.  Over time, contexts of language use and meaning change.  Historians of knowledge
and post-modernists such as Michel Foucault<A HREF="#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> have shown how knowledge, far from
representational, is a <U>constructive</U> process done within social context and historical epoch.  </div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In everyday life, we often observe that the specific significance or meaning of an <U>event</U>
named in language is better understood in retrospect or hindsight.  For example, the significance
of a particular play in a football game is often better understood after the game is over.  A
particular incident as understood by the reader of a mystery novel changes in its significance after
the entire novel is completed.  Unlike capturing an event on photographic film, eye-witness
testimony construes what is "observed" into the psychological <U>context</U> of the meaning system of
the eye-witness.<A HREF="#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>  </div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy observed that "our understanding of the past is altered because
it initiates a new future."<A HREF="#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A>   Working from post-modernist perspective, Walter Brueggemann<STRONG>
</STRONG>illustrates how <U>characterization</U> rather than definition may be the only intellectually honest way to
depict an event or situation.</div><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we ask what the Gulf War of 1991 was, we may take it
<UL>
  <LI><U>as</U> a maintenance of order by the international community,</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI><U>as</U> the protection of self-determination for Kuwait,</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI><U>as</U> the defense of cheap oil,</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI><U>as</U> George Bush's act of machismo, to shed the "wimp" label,</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI><U>as</U> a mop-up for the British Empire in the Middle East, or</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI><U>as</U> the defense of the state of Israel.</LI>
</UL><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formally, any one of these "ases" has as much credence as any other.  None has privilege,
and there is no ultimately right definition.  Each is an act of interpretive construal that is in
part argued and in part simply asserted, but which becomes a basis and warrant for policy
decisions.  A postmodern climate recognizes that there is no given definition and that the
rival claims must simply be argued out.<A HREF="#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A><STRONG></STRONG></div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implications of this argument change the conception of being human from one upon which events
act in predictable ways, to an agent which is <U>dynamically changing and evolving</U> as one is drawn
into the realization of the <U>particularly understood</U> future.    </div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ted Peters<A HREF="#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> suggests that a proleptic or anticipatory view of the present in relationship to
the future gives one a glimpse of what the future might be like.  Wolfhart Pannenberg asserts that
human beings "are on the way to becoming what they are intended to be."<A HREF="#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A>  People live in a
dilemma:   <U>in</U> their egocentricity people strive to <U>overcome</U> that egocentricity and thereby unite
experientially with the world.  The dilemma is that one works through the ego in order to assert
oneself into the world, but it is that very assertion of ego which keeps one separate from the
other!  At best, we get glimpses at what the non-egocentric world outside of one's self is like, but
only in the moments following union in those occasions where we truly are open and non-ego
involved enough to be receptive to the world outside of ourselves.  The afterglow is short lived
because of the attempt to recapture the moment by re-asserting the self  (i.e., ego).  For
Pannenberg, the human ideal <U>and destiny</U>  is peace or harmony between the ego and reality.  </div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddhist conception of dependent co-arising in which there is no separation between
thought and the object of thought, led to interesting implications in the Sarvastivada school of
Buddhism.  Since the Sarvastivadins claimed that all thought had to have an "objective" referent in
reality, they therefore assumed that thoughts about the future gave that future the status of being
real.  Edward Conze, in describing the Sarvastivadin logic, states:  "Without an object no
knowledge can arise, and all our knowledge would be restricted to the bare present."<A HREF="#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A>  If an idea
can be thought of, the object of that thought including what is possible or what the future might
be like must have a referent, albeit mental, in reality.  Therefore, for the Sarvastivadins, time
moves backwards from a realized, albeit mental, future to an incomplete and partial material
present.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar to the Savastivadins, Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy reverses the order of time for the historian from future to past.  ...The unfolding creation
of humankind is not simple reading of the "facts" of history.  Rather, it is an account, a
historical narrative, that is governed by a "sense of the ending," a sense of the common
horizon towards which the whole of humankind moves.  In this way, then, the past can be
appropriated as our collective autobiography.<A HREF="#N_9_"><SUP>(9)</SUP></A><FONT FACE="Courier"></div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destiny becomes the realization of one's future.  Whatever the full realization will be, all of
life leading up to it is partially shaping that realization.  The meaning and significance of all events
leading up to that future will only be partial and incompletely understood until the future is
realized and the significance of past events can be understood in light of where those events have
led.  </div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a broad way, then Sigmund Freud helps us to understand the significance of any act. 
All human actions ultimately lead to the same place--albeit by circuitous routes.  In Freud's words: 
"The aim of all life is death."<A HREF="#N_10_"><SUP>(10)</SUP></A>   In theological terms, one might say that the aim of all life is to
leave the Self and to come into <U>union</U> with the forces of creation or one's Creator.  Sigmund
Freud's concept of "Thanatos" helps us to re-conceive of the determination of human action as
both prediction and postdictive.  Freud suggested that our actions are not only the result of the
push from our origins--the "life instinct" or Eros--but each action thus "propelled," must also be
conceived of as "pulling" us closer to our own deaths (Thanatos).   Thus physical exercise, for
example, not only builds strength and endurance, etc., but also moves along in the aging process. 
Of course, ultimately the forces of life are overcome by the forces of death to which we are
drawn.  Each action in our lives then represents being propelled by the energy of the life force
(Eros), <U>as well as</U> represents being drawn into death (Thanatos).</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of current "understanding" of  the meaning of an event is differently
understood when that event is absorbed into its <U>future</U> context.  Given such a conception, the idea
of  "real," "true," or "ultimate" meaning of an event can only be relative to a point in time and the
context accrued at that time in history.  Any statement about meaning is always partial and given
an <U>incompleted</U> context of understanding.  How can psychologists use such insights and
understanding in explaining human action?  	</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Rapaport<A HREF="#N_11_"><SUP>(11)</SUP></A> has suggested that there is value to postdiction in scientific
understanding.   Postdiction is used in both the social and natural sciences (e.g. history, the theory
of evolution).  As Rapaport states:  "A theory is not invalidated by being postdictive, as long as
postdiction is carefully distinguished from <U>ex post facto</U> explanation.<A HREF="#N_12_"><SUP>(12)</SUP></A>  In light of vast cross-cultural, historical, and temporal variances, I suggest that even analyzing idiographic <U>post-hoc</U> or
<U>ex post facto</U> explanations are legitimate in understanding how an event fits into its future, and
that such analyses might be more helpful than the development of a nomothetic predictive
calculus.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past events are <U>necessary</U> conditions to understanding, but <U>sufficient</U> conditions for
understanding are only possible after the event is drawn into future context.  The problem for
psychologists is that one cannot know the significance of any particular present event until the
future--<U>any particular future</U>--into which it is drawn has materialized.  That future, too, may have
very local meanings depending upon the context of understander--that is, just as in the case of the
Gulf War of 1991, the meanings may not be necessarily mutually exclusive.  </div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of knowing the future before it occurs will not be overcome.  However, to
presuppose that the future is a "blank slate" and is infinitely malleable may be a view that needs
reexamination in light of the constraints of the world and living--namely the confines of <U>reality</U>. 
<U>Rather than being past determinants of the future, reality, and more importantly, our encounter
with it, may be better conceived as partial glimpses of a future already becoming yet incomplete</U>. 
Understanding human behavior, rather than merely elucidating antecedent conditions, is
intrinsically a problem in the interpretation of meaning or significance.  The meaning of any given
event or action in one's life is not ascertainable without the context of the future into which the
behavior is drawn.  It might be more instructive to the psychologist to attempt to discern the
meaningful whole toward which the behavior is moving in order to gauge a behavior's qualitative
significance, rather than to attempt to isolate it as a discrete event with local contextual meaning
which is the culmination of antecedent conditions.  The future, and hence the significance of the
present in light of the future, may be known in <U>partial but fully contextual ways</U> in the same way as
we know about what the Gulf War was about (see Brueggemann above).  Our knowledge, while
malleable as history progresses and our understanding of the significance of the Gulf War
changes, <U>is not incomplete</U>--our understandings are as complete and total as our realized present
context allows us to understand the past.  <U>Our current knowledge of the significance of the Gulf
War in history is no more inferior than will our understanding of the significance of the Gulf War
will be in another decade--as a not yet and becoming history unfolds</U>.  The problem is always one
of ascribing "<U>ultimate meaning</U>" to the present, given an incompletely realized future.  To assume
meaning and significance is endurable is to be epistemologically and hermeneutically
presumptuous.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when it comes to understanding human action, it seems that understanding
needs to occur within the current context, <U>given glimpses of  what the significances of the act
might be in the future</U>.  A thoroughgoing understanding of an action's significance based upon past
determinants does not account for the constructive malleability of meaning as time passes.   At
best, meaning qualified by coordinates of time and place is the only guaranteed authenticity that
the reporter and interpreter of human behavior can give.  Likewise, future understandings need to
be similarly qualified by time and place.  Lastly, the seriousness and gravity of meaning as
represented by human action ought to be also qualified by the appropriateness of such a response
in light of the time and place of both the actor and the interpreter.</div><br>
