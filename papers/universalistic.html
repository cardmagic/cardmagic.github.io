Roger D. Carlson<br>
Whitman College<br><br>

Paper presented at the XXII Interamerican Congress of Psychology<br>
Buenos Aries, June, 1989.</div><br>

<h2 align="center">Abstract</h2>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hope for universal psychological explanations of "basic processes"
that endure across cultures may only be the product of the discursive
practices of a society.  The breakdown of explanations referring to the
universal "basic" processes is most likely to occur cross-culturally.  This
paper uses two types of analyses to examine the proposition that the
psychological explanation of human actions in a culture which is foreign to
that of the "explainer" is epistemologically and metaphysically acceptable. 
Those analytic techniques are borrowed from (a) archeology of knowledge
developed by Michel Foucault, and (b) ordinary language analysis developed by
the philosopher, Ludwig Wittgenstein.  Illustrations are taken from
explanations across cultures in the Americas as well as other countries (e.g.,
psychologists in the United States attempting to understanding the political
actions of Argentineans, and Argentineans attempting to understand the
psychological basis of the political actions of United States citizens.  The
paper concludes that such explanations and the methods which produce them are
fictions which serve the purposes of a particular culture.  Unless the
purposes of two societies are shared, the imposition of one explanation over
another society only produces an illusion of explanation from the point of
view of the imposing society.</div><br><br><br>


<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally psychologists seek to give <U>general</U> explanations of human
behavior in the form of laws and theories.  Like physicists, psychologists
seek to give explanations of human behavior in the form of laws and theories.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A critical question is whether such explanations can ever be made specific
enough to explain behavior <U>across cultures</U>.  That is, are the general laws and
theories that are developed in psychology specific enough to adequately
account for the specific diversity evidenced in human behavior across
cultures?  The purpose of this paper is to examine this question using the
modern techniques of Ludwig Wittgenstein and Michel Foucault.  </div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Methodological Note</U>.  This paper is concerned with the fundamental
assumptions which are inherent in the ways psychologists pursue knowledge and
understanding.  The approach used herein in analyzing psychological
explanation is not an empirical approach, but rather <U>conceptual analysis</U> which
is commonly used by philosophical psychologists.  In doing such analysis the
author is drawing upon the methods of the later work of the philosopher Ludwig
Wittgenstein (1953), and those of psychologist/philosopher Michel Foucault
(1965, 1970).  Wittgenstein's approach, known as ordinary language philosophy,
was fundamental in discovering critical flaws in the philosophical foundations
of logical positivism (Stevens, 1963, Hartnack, 1962) upon which most modern
psychological methodology and theorizing is based.  Wittgenstein argues for
consensuality of knowledge as opposed to knowledge universals (or "logical
atoms" derived by either experimental or logical analysis [Russell, 1956]). 
Likewise, Foucault's work which he called archeology of knowledge, endeavored
to describe the taxonomy of knowledge/power systems developed by cultures
which contribute to the creation of discursive and political practices.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author's working assumption is that before methods and theoretical
practices of psychology are accepted at face value, the assumptions entailed
in those methods and theoretical practices ought to be critically examined.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Wittgenstein on Knowledge and Society</U>.  For Wittgenstein, knowledge is
something that is based in language and on the tacit rules for using knowledge
terms in the language.  What constitutes an "explanation" is governed by the
tacit rules for using the word "explanation" by the language users of a
particular culture.  Therefore, the criterion for the adequacy of an
explanation is dependent upon the users of the language in the culture.  This
also implies that the criterion for correctness in using a term such as
"explanation" is social.  Therefore if E is generally <U>said</U> to be and accepted
as an "explanation" in a given culture, then it <U>is</U> an explanation.<U></U></div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Foucault on Language, Knowledge, Culture, and Politics</U>.  For Foucault,
knowledge is a derivative of the taxonomy that language<U> </U>parcels up our
experience.  Language is the cultural fabric of knowledge systems.  Knowing
oneself, or knowing one's own culture is only possible given the taxonomical
structure of knowledge of the knower (or the language users of a society). 
Knowing a country necessitates knowing how the language structures political
relationships between people in the country.  Knowledge becomes difficult if
not impossible if one does not know the culture's language or language game. 
Linguistic taxonomies are developed in order that a given society can
accomplish particular purposes and goals.  All linguistic taxonomies and their
derivative knowledge systems connote implied political relations.  Examples of
linguistic taxonomies which have obvious political implications are
"professor"/"student", "doctor"/"mental patient", "speaker"/"audience",
"host"/"guest", "underdeveloped countries"/"developed countries".  Each of the
above examples has implied political power relations and certain behavioral
expectations on the part of actors.  </div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Cross Cultural Understanding and Explanation</U>.  <U>Explaining</U> the behavior
(e.g., political behavior) of another culture using concepts developed in an
outside culture becomes difficult if not impossible without knowing what
constitutes "explanation" in the culture in which the behavior is being
explained.  Knowing what constitutes "explanation" is contingent upon knowing
that culture's tacit rules for using the word, "explanation."  In saying, for
example, that we as U.S. citizens do not <U>understand</U> the practice of taking
people against their will for interrogation without arrest warrants or other
legal accountability, we are, in fact, saying that this practice is
unintelligible.  It does not "make sense" in terms of the culture in which <U>we</U>
live--namely the culture of the U.S.  By the same token, an Argentinean who
says that (s)he does not understand what U.S. citizens mean by "human rights"
does not understand the culture of the United States.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<U>Explaining</U>" cross-cultural behavior becomes especially difficult.  What
culture A (Argentinean) considers "explained", culture E (U.S. culture) does
not.  Conversely what culture E considers "explained," culture A does not. 
The difficulty lies in knowledge of the criteria used in a culture for use of
the word "explained."</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the sort of difficulty that takes place on an everyday level
of cross-cultural discourse in which different language games are being used,
the problem is compounded where professionals are attempting to "understand"
and "explain" cross-culturally using psychological theory.  The application of
a theory which is "foreign" to the actor does not make intelligible in <U>his/her
knowledge terms</U> his/her own behavior.  Theories and explanations serve the
social/political purposes of the <U>culture doing the explaining</U> rather than the
culture that is explained.  For that reason explanations imposed from outside
of the culture being explained may appear from within that culture as
unintelligible.  Language/discourse in a knowledge/power relationship serves
to make one culture intelligible to the culture doing the explaining.  In
these terms, the purposes for explanation are for the <U>culture doing the
explaining</U>.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider, for example, the knowledge/power relationship in the use of
terms like "developed" countries vs. "underdeveloped" or "third world"
countries.  Such terms encapsulate particular knowledge/power relationships
between countries which are <U>not</U> neutral.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as psychologists' activity is within language, that language
cannot be neutral, and usually is of a form which is alien to that of people
within the culture that is explained.  As an aside, the language of Pavlov
seems intelligible in terms of the automaticity of behavior expected in the
culture of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in which it was developed
and used, the language of Freud intelligible in terms of the culture of
puritanical Vienna (and conversely the attractiveness of psychoanalytic
explanations to puritanical United States culture), the language of Skinner is
understandable in terms of the Horatio Algier possibilities and profit motive
of the culture of the United States, and the language of Spearman (<U>g</U>
intelligence) is comprehensible in terms of the traditional intellectual caste
system of the British.  Understanding cultures outside of the language-taxonomical systems of the explaining culture is not possible because of the
power relations in the language-taxonomical systems of the explainer's
language tacitly performs.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hope for a "universal" language that can make <U>all</U> human actions
everywhere intelligible is misguided in that <U>language itself is a cultural
system which serves the political-social purposes of the explaining culture.</U></div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding can better be seen by analyzing the political
relationships between actors <U>within</U> a given culture v. presuming that our
culturally developed linguistic system, English, in the United States can be
imposed upon another culturally developed linguistic system, namely that of
Argentina.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of all of this?  Where is there hope?  The outlook is a pessimistic
yet philosophically defensible one.  Given these views, "explanation" must be
understood within the context of the <U>explaining</U> culture since "explanation" is
a term tacitly used and understood in terms of the explaining culture's needs
and purposes.  The explanation of one culture <U>may</U> be used to "explain"
another, as we, in our culture, tacitly understand the use of the word
"explain."  However, it is only "explained" in the context of the explainer's
culture.  Argentineans can not be expected to know what U.S. citizens mean by
"human rights" any more than U.S. citizens can be expected to know what
Argentineans have known and experienced as "terrorism."  We <U>can</U> make judgments
about another culture but <U>only in terms of our own knowledge/power discursive
practices</U>.  The use of the foreign <U>discursive</U> practices to explain a culture
can only result in a fictionalism as ludicrous as applying psychoanalytic
terms and concepts to one that in a reasoned way, resists the adequacy of
those explanations concerning their own behavior.  Likewise "explaining" a
psychologist's humanistic approach in behavioral terms only results in a
meaningless reductionism and the supremacy of the behaviorist.  Such
"explanations" only result in a kind of theoretical and/or conceptual
imperialism.  They don't "explain" the behavior of the humanist in a way which
is satisfactory to the humanist.  When U.S. citizens say that, for example,
Argentineans do not respect human rights in the context of <U>la guerra sucia</U>,
that is not a sufficient commentary <U>in the context of the lives of
Argentineans</U> who insist that <U>la guerra sucia</U> must be understood within the
context of political terrorism.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As shown in Foucault's work on the politics of language, language has
political structure.  When actions are carried through based upon the
discursive linguistic practices of a culture, then we have at a behavioral
level practices that might be called a language of politics.  The politics of
language and the language of politics may related.  Cross-cultural
understanding only can be attained in a non-verbal observational relational
form where socio-political relations between actors are observed and
described.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sum, true explanation must be <U>intra</U>-cultural, not <U>intercultural</U>.  It
must take account of what constitutes "<U>explanation</U>" within its own culture and
the kinds of cultural constructs and practices which make the behavior
intelligible within a linguistic milieu</U>.  The hope for developing "universal" language
would <U>by definition</U> destroy what it means to have a <U>culture</U>. </div><br>
