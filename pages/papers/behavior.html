<h1>Judging Explanations of Behavior: Issues in Establishing Taxonomy, Hierarchy, and Admissibility</h1>
Roger D. Carlson<br>
Whitman College<br><br>

Paper presented at the First Annual Meeting of the American Psychology<br>
Society, Arlington, Virginia, June, 1989.<br><br>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explanations of behavior are wide ranging (e.g., scientific, historical,
introspective, contextual, experiential).  The adequacy of various
explanations is debatable.  This paper examines the possibility of developing
a taxonomy of explanation, a hierarchy of desirability (or "goodness") of
explanations, and standards for the admissibility or acceptability of an
explanation for human action.</div><br>
<br><br>
<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychology is generally regarded as having as one of its goals the
<U>explanation</U> of human action.  What constitutes "explanation" is often debated. 
Psychologists having different theoretical or applied approaches debate as to
what explanation is the "best."  Skinnerians, physiological psychologists, and
cognitive psychologists debate over the adequacy of their respective
explanations.  Psychoanalysts, behavior therapists, humanistic psychologists,
and cognitive therapists debate over which explanatory approach to therapy is
the "best."  Lay people wonder why psychologists sometimes have a tendency to
belabor the obvious, explain away a phenomenon, or "beat a dead horse."  They
also seem puzzled as to why there is a multiplicity of theories and
explanations for behavior about which psychologists have a hard time agreeing. 
At the bottom of such debates is the question of what is considered an
<U>adequate</U> explanation.  Often what is considered adequate is probably guided by
the needs and purposes of the explainer.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this paper is to examine the issues involved in creating
a taxonomy, hierarchy, and standards for admissibility of an explanation for
human action.	</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Methodological Note</U>.  This paper is concerned with the fundamental
assumptions which are inherent in the ways psychologists pursue knowledge and
understanding.  The approach used herein in analyzing psychological
explanation is not an empirical approach, but rather <U>conceptual analysis</U> which
is commonly used by philosophical psychologists.  In doing such analysis the
author is drawing upon the methods of the later work of the philosopher Ludwig
Wittgenstein (1953), and those of psychologist/philosopher Michel Foucault
(1970).  Wittgenstein's approach, known as ordinary language philosophy, was
fundamental in discovering critical flaws in the philosophical foundations of
logical positivism (Stevens, 1963, Hartnack, 1962) upon which most modern
psychological methodology and theorizing is based.  Wittgenstein argues for
consensuality of knowledge as opposed to knowledge universals (or "logical
atoms" derived by either experimental or logical analysis [Russell, 1956]). 
Likewise, Foucault's work which he called archeology of knowledge, endeavored
to describe the taxonomy of knowledge/power systems developed by cultures
which contribute to the creation of discursive and political practices.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author's working assumption is that before methods and theoretical
practices of psychology are accepted at face value, the assumptions entailed
in those methods and theoretical practices ought to be critically examined.	<U></U></div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Varieties of Explanation.</U>  There are numerous kinds of explanations of
human action.  This paper is not meant to be encyclopedic, but rather to use
illustrative types of explanations which should be considered in developing a
taxonomy, a hierarchy, and standards for admissibility.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientific explanations in psychology come in many varieties.  Radical
behaviorists are satisfied that behavior is adequately explained when a
functional relationship is described.  Prediction and control of behavior are
what constitute "explanation" (Skinner, 1953).  Such prediction and control
elucidates the causal variables of which behavior is a function.  By way of
contrast, cognitive psychologists often do not find such behavioral
explanations adequate, and seek to clarify such functional relationships by
making reference to cognitive hypothetical constructs (e.g., schema [Bartlett,
1932], scripts [Schank &amp; Abelson, 1976], and the like).</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commonly it is suggested that debates about theoretical adequacy are
resolved by appeal to such criteria as parsimony, generality, and heuristic
value (Marx, 1963).  The use of such criteria have a long tradition in the
history of science (Hempel, 1966), and in particular, logical positivism
(Stevens, 1963).  The difficulty with the use of such criteria in psychology
is that although their use is often espoused, resolution of controversies
between theories are rarely resolved by either their tacit or explicit use. 
The debates between adherents to differing theoretical approaches often
resemble debates between holders of ideologies rather than dispassion and
impartiality usually ascribed to scientists and professional practitioners. 
The adherence to a particular theoretical viewpoint probably has a lot to do
with the purposes that the explainer has for the explanation rather than in
any intrinsic worth of the explanation itself.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other kinds of explanation are the kinds of explanations given by
astronomers which are not causal but descriptive.  Such goodness of fit is
approximated by use of the psychological model.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, the clinical psychologist has different kinds of problems
than the psychological theoretician or model builder with respect to
explanation.  Explanation within the clinical context is often said to be
achieved when the clinician discovers a history, psychological story, or habit
patterns which makes intelligible or understandable the current behavioral
displays of a client.  Because the explanatory approach is directed toward the
individual, it is an idiographic (vs. nomothetic) approach to explanation
(Allport, 1961).  The clinician endeavors to find ways in order to minimize or
redirect the deleterious effects of the antecedents to the condition which are
specific to the client's life.  Because the purpose for explanation is goal
directed for the clinician, it is questionable whether or not direct
applications from scientific theory to practice are possible.  Scientific
concepts such as "scripts,"  "beliefs," "cognitions," "reinforcers" may help
guide the clinicians hypotheses, but the specific explanatory power of such
concepts comes alive only when the particulars of the client's life become
explicated.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related to the sort of explanation that the clinician is trying to
obtain is the type of explanation given by a detective as to how or why a
crime was committed, and by whom.  In such instances explanations are more in
the form of hypothetical creations which are testable against the criterion of
proof (which has as a goal, substantiated confession).  Truth comes in the
form of a theory (or hypothesis) that is shown to be the case.  The kind of
truth ultimately achieved is a good deal more substantial than the kind of
truth achieved by the model-building psychologist.  The kind of truth which is
discovered by the clinician is a kind of <U>informative</U> truth.  By way contrast,
a theory of the origins of criminal behavior is an elucidating truth leading
to <U>understanding</U>.  Nevertheless it should be noted that truth for the
detective, the clinical psychologist, and the psychological theoretician is a
function of a particular ontological and metaphysical perspective--a
perspective created by the discursive character of the culture of which the
explainer is a part--which includes the constituent culture building blocks of
truth, knowledge, and language with which the explainer creates an explanation
(Szasz, 1960, Foucault, 1965, 1970).  	</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gulf between the kind of discoveries which lead to advances in
scientific theory or models, and the kind of advance which is made by the
clinical psychologist might be described as the distinction between advancing
<U>knowledge</U> versus <U>information</U>.  The kind of ac<U>knowledge</U>ment that is shown by
the person who agrees that he now understands in a way that he hadn't before
by virtue of the development of a new theory or model, has new insight--a new
perspective.  When some<U>thing</U> has been <U>discovered</U> (or uncovered) as a new
"truth," then <U>information</U> has been advanced.  For example, the development of
cognition as an important mediator in the understanding of depression led to
profoundly important <U>understandings</U> of the ways in which negative life events
and thoughts can be thought of as interrelated but the specific combination of
attributional factors predisposing one to depression in the face of negative
life events is <U>informative</U>.  In the first case, our <U>understanding</U> is advanced;
in the second case <U>information</U> is advanced.  While the former is useful in
terms of enlightenment, the latter is useful in terms of practice.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary explanations for human actions given and accepted by non-psychologists every day.  Many ordinary explanations given by people daily
would not be considered adequate by psychologists.  The average person does
not need or require the kind of explanatory rigor that is required by most
psychologists.  Why is that the case?  Frequently behavior is said to be
"explained" when there is no puzzlement left in the mind of the person making
inquiry.  Indeed, many ordinary behaviors are understood as being so much a
part of the culture that explanation of them seems unnecessary, trite,
trivial, and superfluous.  Flying a kite, standing with one's hands in one's
pockets, wearing a shirt (or not wearing a shirt) are all instances in which
further explanation would seem superfluous if not trivial.  Of course
understanding of these behaviors is always context dependent.  For example,
flying a kite in the middle of a hurricane, standing with one's hands in one's
pockets when being asked to play a drum, and not wearing a shirt while one is
on a ski slope are all situations which probably would not be understood in
context and thus have the need for further explanation.  It is in instances
that elicit puzzlement in people that psychologists are queried about the
origins of a particular behavior.  Behavior exhibited in unusual contexts is
one instance which elicits puzzlement in the observers and thus invites further explanation
(Leifer, 1964).</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Standards for Admissibility.</U>  Before considering how to prioritize and
create a hierarchy for various kinds of explanations, one needs to decide what
is minimally acceptable to qualify for admissibility as an explanation of
human action.  At a <U>minimal</U> level, the use of a consensual criterion
(Wittgenstein, 1953) seems necessary.  That is, if people generally agree that
what is offered as an explanation <U>is</U> what we would ordinarily <U>call</U> an
explanation in ordinary language (family resemblance), then it ought to be
admissible as an explanation.  If we would <U>agree</U> that what is offered as an
explanation is what we generally would accept as an explanation, then we have
a first step to comprehensibility.  Of course such a consensual step for
admission is necessarily based upon a <U>culture's</U> conceptual and discursive
habits in a particular time and place.  It is necessary that there be
recognition of other cultural practices in other times and places making the
behavior comprehensible in a way which would be satisfactory to that culture.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimate <U>definition</U> of what constitutes "explanation" is avoided here
out of recognition that definition itself is based upon use.  (Not left
unnoticed is the fact that the very words which I presently write are based
upon the cultural fabric of relativism in which I live.  Certainly such a
relativistic stance is not a historical and cultural constant, and thus
dismissing universalism is not possible.  Only relativism can provide for such
an inclusive explanatory system.  But as such it is necessary to <U>universally</U>
posit <U>relativism</U> to provide for such inclusion.  Such a positing is justified
by the generally accepted desirability of acknowledging different perspectives
of psychological explanation rather than closing court on the issue whereby
limitations in outlook become paramount.  Universalists who become committed
to a singular perspective or paradigm (e.g., radical behaviorism) do not allow
for the kind of flexibility which is endemic to and necessary for the
scientist's continual <U>search for</U> truth.)</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Taxonomy.</U>  While this is not the forum for the development of a specific
taxonomy of explanations, it must be remembered that such a taxonomy ought to
be developed in a lateral manner.  Rather than prematurely assume superiority
of scientific over lay explanations, both the history of such taxonomical
systems (e.g., Foucault, 1970) and the use of consensual criteria for their
acceptability necessitates the admission of a variety of explanatory
approaches that need to be equally considered before arbitrarily making
decisions based upon history, tradition, and prevailing thought.  There are
language using constituencies who would consider admissible explanations of
the following sort: scientific, historical, introspective, contextual,
experimental, theological, astrological, characterological, mythological, etc. 
The attributes and the social/political, epistemological, and metaphysical
functions of each ought to be given an honest hearing before developing a
hierarchy.  The development of a lateral taxonomy of such explanatory
approaches would serve the function of explicating the functional features of
these consensually acceptable explanatory approaches before establishing
hierarchy.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Hierarchy.</U>  Once one agrees that <U>E</U> is an explanation one needs to decide
how it fares as an explanation.  One that is "incorrect" or does not account
for the facts will probably be rejected in favor of one which does account for
the data.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some explanations serve as critiques to popular theories of human
action.  To the extent that the scientist discovers facts which are contrary
to prevailing thought that scientist is acting as a social critic.  For
example, the demonstration that scores on intelligence tests are highly
modifiable by environmental circumstances serves as a corrective a commonly
held belief that such scores reflect a constant in hereditary endowment. 
Although such <U>information</U> based upon empirical investigation changes our view
of the malleability of intelligence to a limited extent, it does not provide a
general <U>understanding</U> of intelligence.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond that, criteria for a hierarchy become difficult to determine. 
What makes, for example, "scientific" explanation "better" than explanations
given by a non-psychologist? </div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often scientific explanations are judged to be superior to ordinary
explanations of human action.  When a psychologist explains a child's whining
by speaking of the history of parents' reinforcing the child for whining, what
makes such an explanation superior to that of a non-psychologist who says that
the child is whining because she wants the candy?  From a perspective given by
ordinary language philosophy, one would say that "explanation" has been
achieved when most language users in the language using collective would agree
that was is given is an "explanation" of a particular human action.  If one
accepts such a standard for the admissibility of an explanation, then one
needs to decide how to determine what explanations are "better" than others. 
Consensual criteria seem important to invoke at the outset.  If the language
using community agrees that explanation <U>E</U>' is "better" than explanation <U>E</U>,
then <U>E</U>' should be accepted over <U>E</U>.  In the context of the example above, it
seems that the most appropriate explanation must be judged by those who are
using the word "explanation."  If the group who is listening to the
explanation are non-psychologists, no doubt the child's wanting the candy is
explanatory.  If the group who is listening to the explanation are
psychologists, the reinforcement explanation will no doubt be more
satisfactory.  If when the child whines and is given the candy, the child
throws the candy on the floor, then the non-psychologist who accepted the
"wanting the candy" explanation may turn to the psychologist for further
explanation (e.g., other operative reinforcers).  So on an everyday basis what
constitutes explanation is probably consensual.  As a general rule then, one
might posit that <U>ordinary explanations are usually expected for ordinary
behavior, and the psychologist's more esoteric explanations for ordinary
behavior are acceptable only when the behavior no longer appears to be
ordinary</U>.	</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In developing a hierarchy of explanation, three "levels" seem obvious. 
At the lowest level is the explanation which is agreed by the language using
community to an what it considers an "explanation," but for one reason or
another is so far removed from the data-base that it is considered to be
unsatisfactory in its explanatory power by most people is the language using
community.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the next level, social criticism done by psychologists serve as
correctives for erroneous beliefs which are not supported by factual content. 
Such criticism is important and powerful yet is limited in terms of its
explanatory specificity of content, narrowness of scope, and purposive, goal-directed character.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also at this level is the sort of explanation done by clinical
psychologists who endeavor to "solve a mystery" concerning the behavioral
displays of a client.  This sort of explanation is also of limited value in
giving a <U>general</U> understanding of human action.  This limitation was probably
one of the oversights of Freud in extending the explanations given to the
clients that he saw to people outside of the psychoanalytic context.  Probably
it was this oversight which has led to a good deal of skepticism by the
general public of psychoanalytic explanations of everyday behavior.  Like
social criticism, the clinical psychologists gives explanations which are
limited by specificity of content, narrowness of scope, and purposive, goal-directed character.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adequacy of general accounts are what are most often debated and are
often used to counter ordinary explanations.  If what is offered as
explanatory is accepted as "explanatory" by the language using community to
which it is offered, its adequacy must be contingent upon serving the needs of
enlightenment to that constituency.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since explanatory elitism or scientific imperialism can only serve to
further social/political purposes and results in alienating people who might
otherwise by served by the methodological skills and conceptual insights
possessed by psychologists, an attitude of egalitarianism seems to be called
for.</div><br>
