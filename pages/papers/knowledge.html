<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What constitutes human knowledge?  Philosophers answer this question in many
ways.  When we say knowledge advances, by virtue of what do we make this claim? 
Traditionally, acceptable explanations must meet standards such as parsimony,
comprehensiveness, and have heuristic value (Marx, 1963).  When a theory or model "fits"
the data to be explained well, when it does so simply, and when it promotes research,
we consider it to be a "good theory," or a "good explanation."  From a perspective that
looks at the transactions involved, however, a valid explanation is a functional unit
that resolves a question in the mind of a wonderer.  To do so, an account must be on
the same ordinal level as the query that it answers.  For example, imagine a child
walking into a behavioral laboratory and seeing a rat in a Skinner box.  A psychology
professor approaches her and asks her a question:  "Why does that rat press that lever?" 
And she replies "The rat presses the lever to get food because he's hungry."  Her
explanation is at a level that she can understand and which resolves her own perplexity. 
At this point, at least in reference to the rat in the Skinner box, she has knowledge
about the world. and the world makes sense.  </div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the little girl grows older, however, she has increasingly complex
interactions within the context of a verbal community.  She goes to school, reads books,
and observes her own behavior and the behavior of others, always integrating more and
more information.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually she enters college and once again finds herself in a behavioral
laboratory.  The same psychology professor, having now secured tenure, asks her the same
question:  Why does that rat press that lever?  Her reply is much different than it was
fifteen years ago:  "The rat was deprived of food for 24 hours.  He was then reinforced
with food pellets for successive approximations of lever pressing behavior until the
desired outcome was established.  The lever pressing behavior is maintained on a fixed
ratio schedule of 15."  Her explanation is still at a level that she understands and
which resolves her own perplexity.  She feels that she knows the world and the world
makes sense to her. And we would all probably agree that her knowledge had increased. 
She would certainly think so.  But how much closer to the absolute truth of the matter
is she?  From an ontological perspective, she has only just begun to explain the rat
and its behavior. How does reinforcement work?  What about drive-reduction theory?  Does
the animal think?  Could divine intervention be involved?  In fact, the relationship
between her explanation and the absolute truth, if there is any absolute truth, is
ultimately unknowable.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper attempts to answer the question of whether or not knowledge evolves
in such a way that the "truths" of explanation stand independent from mere rhetoric,
discourse, or communicative changes in the social domain of explainers and listeners. 
In other words, can it be argued that knowledge somehow stands apart from the domain
of language use, and thus denotes a kind of "pure" truth, independent of the linguistic
interactions and conventions of the explainer and the listener?  When the knowledge of
a society "advances," in what sense, if any, does this societal knowledge approach
absolute truth?  In many ways, a society is like our little girl.  As it matures,
observations and transactions within a verbal community render increasing amounts of
information which are integrated and discussed.  As information increases, the old
answers to the questions of life seem inadequate.  Accordingly, new explanations arise
to resolve the consensual perplexity of the verbal community.  When general perplexity
is resolved, we say that knowledge has advanced.  But is this consensual knowledge any
different from the personal knowledge of our little girl?  Is it any closer to absolute
truth?  Ontologically speaking, who knows?</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for example, the concept of intelligence.  Early psychological questions
concerning the nature of intelligence were answered by unitary explanations such as
Spearman's "g" factor.  Over the course of time, multiple notions of intelligence, such
as Guilford's, or even more recently, Sternberg's and Gardener's, have been gaining
acceptance.  Is there an absolutely pure and true model of intelligence toward which
psychology ever draws nearer?  Or, do we just continually package it differently,
encapsulating it in more and different ways as the societal applications of what we call
intelligence change?</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The philosophical works of Ludwig Wittgenstein and Michel Foucault struggle with
issues such as these.  For instance, Wittgenstein, in his later philosophical work
(1953) argued against the possibility of having a private language.  Any language, in
the usual sense of the concept, must communicate, and thus involves interpersonal
interaction.  Linguistic conventions enjoin language users in a verbal community, and
thus, people share the criteria for the appropriate use of a particular unit of
language.  Hence, we infer from the work of Wittgenstein that the phenomena of
"explanation" and of "understanding" lie within the social domain rather than in any
domain of absolute truth.  Knowledge, from this point of view, is inherently consensual
and transactional.  Thus, to use our example, when referring to "intelligence" and
modifications in the "intelligence" concept, Wittgenstein would assign the locus of
change to the language using practices of people and the societal needs which
necessitate a modification in the concept of intelligence.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligence tests were, in fact, first developed for pragmatic reasons.  When
one develops an intelligence test, a question of validity also emerges, namely:  "What
do intelligences tests test?"  The obvious answer must be "intelligence."  The trouble
with this conception is that <U>intelligence</U>, which is initially a qualataive commentary
on behavior, is now viewed as a thing to be quantified.  That is, instead of thinking
of intelligence in the way that is implied by the sentence, "John solved his problem
of having two dates on Saturday night intelligently," we become concerned with <U>how much</U>
intelligence John <U>has</U>.  Viewing intelligence as something that is quantifiable has
obvious practical and political implications.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foucault, in his book, <U>The Order of Things</U> (1970), likewise seems to construe
knowledge as an inherently social/political phenomenon rather than something absolute
which progresses as science modifies it. For Foucault, social and political advantages
occur by creating particular discursive practices.  Foucault interprets language as the
idioms and taxonomy of a society and it thereby allows for the treatment of particular
people in particular ways.  For example, by dichotomizing the world into distinct groups
such as students and professors, mental patients and doctors, and those with high
intelligence and those with low intelligence, certain practices are condoned which make
the former subservient to the latter in each of these cases.  Hence, we infer from
Foucault that knowledge, and the taxonomy of that knowledge, in a particular society,
at a particular time is instrumental in that it implies certain specific qualitative
relationships between people.  Thus, to return to our example, when referring to
intelligence and modifications in the intelligence concept, Foucault would say that
change occurs in response to socio-political power relationships that evolve as a
function of society's use of the idioms and taxonomies of language.  In other words, 
"knowledge" evolves in response to socially prescribed criteria.  What we come to know
generally is what we want or need to know, regardless of that knowledge's position
relative to any absolute truth.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are we to make of knowledge which evolves or changes?  Suppose a person who
once used and understood "naive" explanations and found them satisfactory, later went
on to use "sophisticated" behavioral explanations.  Would we say that she now has a more
"sophisticated" explanation?  If so, what are we to say if this person then goes on to
decide that a cognitive explanation of the rat's bar-pressing is even more satisfactory
than the behavioral account?  Has the person's knowledge progressed or regressed?  Or,
more radically, what if a rigorous, experimentally sophisticated approach to
understanding the development and acquisition of knowledge was later displaced by a more
humanistic explanation?  Is this progress or not?  Probably the most which could be
claimed is that the language user's criteria for explanation and understanding have
<U>changed</U>.  What is now satisfactory as explanatory was not satisfactory before, and what
was then satisfactory is not now. Which paradigm more closely approximates a <U>true</U>
explanation is unimportant.  Explainers and the language of explaining change as do the
needs and purposes for explanation, but none of this necessarily constitutes movement
toward "truth."</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common links between Wittgenstein and Foucault, then, emerge, in respect to
extant knowledge, as language and discourse being the transactional medium in which
consensus occurs, and, in respect to new knowledge, language and discourse act as
functional precursors which set the occasion for new explanations to develop and to be
accepted.  The criteria for the "goodness" of a model or theory, then, lie in consensual
linguistic transactions that arise in response to socio-political phenomena.  The
proximity to an absolute truth may be perceived as growing ever closer, but this
relationship is actually relative and ultimately unknowable.   This dramatically
contrasts the  common science oriented belief that knowledge possesses an inherent value
and that new knowledge arises as the pure methodology of science brings us ever closer
to the absolute truths of the cosmos.  If the claim were made that an absolute and
unchangeable truth is approximated, or even attained, Wittgenstein and Foucault would
probably say that such a claim is unverifiable and temporary. In as much as human
knowledge is concerned, good explanations are those that result in good understanding
on the level of consensual validation within the larger sphere of societal wants and
needs.   </div><br>
