Paper presented at the meeting of the American Psychological Society<br>
San Diego, California, June, 1992.</div><br>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The American Psychological Society motto reads, "Advancing the
scientific discipline and the giving away of psychology in the public
interest."  As it advertises itself as such, methodologies and theories of
scientific psychology are frequently viewed as austere, independent, and aloof
which miss the expectations and interests of the public.  So while
paradoxically psychologists frequently advocate the scientist/practitioner
model, in the interest of maximizing objectivity the discipline remains
curiously isolated.  While as a scientific discipline, the fruits of its
research endeavors do not regularly acknowledge the discipline's own social
dimension (and agenda), it nonetheless gives pretensions of operating in a
contextual vacuum.  We argue that the very pretensions that psychology makes
to being science are unnecessary, counterfeit, and constricts the kind of
rigorous enlightenment that psychologists have to offer.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a parallel fashion, the reactionary humanistic and phenomenological
corrective of highlighting the subjective and experiential reinforces a
tendency toward over-valuing private experience, thereby giving emphasis to
the person by the extraction of the person from the social milieu, thereby
giving rise to such notions as individuality, functional autonomy,
differentiation, internality and the like.  Such isolationism makes a theorist
prone to solipsism by emphasizing uniqueness and privatism in the quality of
experience.  </div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the arbitrary and non-scientific moral, political
categorizations and prescriptions made of the individual by clinical
psychologists results in a further extraction and alienation of the person
from the rich social embeddedness of everyday life.  </div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, instead of a person's life being characterized as presently
<U>defined</U> by a political, social, and linguistic history, the person appears in
contention, confrontation, and alienation from society.  The overly objective
account makes the human appear barren, two dimensional, and sterile, whereas
the overly subjective account makes the human appear isolated and alone.  In
an effort to emphasize <U>individual</U> psychology, both accounts seem only to give
lip-service to the social embeddedness of the experience of the person (and
that of the discourses that psychologists give) by speaking tokenistically of
social determination.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, psychology is at a privileged epistemological juncture between
empiricism, philosophical speculation, and practice, but has yet to
acknowledge and to take full advantage of this position.  More than any other
social science, psychology has cultivated its indebtedness to both science and
philosophy, and continues to make strides in all these arenas independently. 
More than any other discipline, it can be argued that psychology occupies the
best vantage point from which to reconcile Gesieswissenshaften (mind science)
and Naturwissenshaften (natural science).</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, however, psychology is far from fulfilling itself in these
respects.  This juncture between the empirical, philosophical, and practical
is neither harmonious, symbiotic, nor balanced in what Gadamer might call a
"healthy tension."  More often than not, this privileged position is eclipsed
from all sides from psychology's overidentification with the "hard" sciences,
its correlative eschewing of philosophy, and the subsequent reliance on a
curious, yet mysterious amalgam of all or none of the above, particularly
within the clinical setting.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each such constituency in psychology is in its struggle to own/author the
human psyche.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the history of the discipline, the professional psychologist
finds him/herself between a rock and a hard place.  On the one hand sitting on
the rock, we find the thinker, the rationalist, the speculator, the
philosopher who is shunned as non-scientific.  In the hard place, is the press
for aspiring to "hard" scientific pretensions by trying to fit what we
understand as social and interactive, into the mold of "data" and scientific
theory.  Neither role fits the person seeking to understand human action
because each create a distance from our being-ness--one, a rational distance,
and the other, an empirical distance.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we stuck between psychology as science or psychology as common
sense?	Are we stuck between the dilemma of psychology as impossible or
psychology as trivial?  We think that there are options other than these.</div><br>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We propose a solution that emerges from the contemporary work of
philosophers.  In a previous work (Carlson and Hadjikhani, 1992) we questioned
the necessity of the distinction between the objective and the subjective. 
Here, adding to the work of Wittgenstein and Foucault, we propose a
hermeneutical corrective to psychology which criticizes the Kantian position
bestowing normative power to centrality of "data" and theory in the methods
and criteria of the natural sciences.  We seek to bring the insights of
philosophy to the fore of psychology by uncovering the concrete ways in which
philosophical hermeneutics is "always already" (anti) present in the person,
position, and symbolics of the clinical psychologist.</div><br>

<h2>Philosophical Perspectives</h2>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Wittgenstein.</U>  The ordinary language philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein
establishes that the criteria for knowing a concept rests in the social nexus
of its <U>use</U> in a purposive way.  It is the individual's <U>social</U> history of use
of concepts and knowledge of exemplars which serves as socially, shared
criteria for correctness of meaning.  Such social knowledge is imbedded in a
one's <U>individual</U> (private) history of sociality.  Therefore knowledge of other
minds is <U>not</U> a mystery.  When evidence of the shared criteria for knowing a
concept is recognized (<U>either individually or collectively</U>), we say that we
have an "understanding" of the mind of another person at which point the
distinction between subjectivity and objectivity collapses.  For Wittgenstein,
it is language (consensual) relationships which are paramount in defining
knowledge.   </div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Foucault.</U>  Knowledge is something which has political, moral, ethical,
and historical purposes within the time and place of a particular society. 
Knowledge is <U>not</U> "pure" and enduring but rather serves the purposes of people
within a particular society.  For Foucault, it is social (power) relationships
which are paramount in defining knowledge.<U></U></div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Gadamer.</U>  In a hermeneutic paradigm, the fundamental data of the social
sciences are neither simple nor atomistic.  On the contrary, data consist of
meanings, intentions, plans, goals, and purposes.  Here, the objects being
studied are subjects embedded in cultural practice, who think, construe,
understand, misunderstand, interpret, change, as well as reflect on the
meanings they produce.  Human life and human theories are inescapably enmeshed
in a "web of meaning" which necessarily obviates the notions of "facts" and
professionals existing <U>in vitro</U> and apart from the interpretive process. 
Accordingly, there is a shared and public nature to the contexts in
significance that mediate human awareness.  Tradition and history are not
barriers to understanding, rather they are indispensable to it.  Only in terms
of our cultural images, institutions, etc. can we know ourselves and others at
all.  History does not belong to us, we belong to it.  Gadamer welcomes
prejudice.  Science's prejudice against prejudice with its attempt to rid
oneself of the same, leads to greater falsification and deeper concealment. 
Bias is the <U>vehicle</U> of our openness.  For Gadamer, it is relations of form
against form (change, montage, enlightenment, or altered consciousness) that
are paramount in defining knowledge.</div><br>

<h2>Resolution</h2>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The odd amalgam of psychology's concern with the empirical, the
philosophical, and the practical is perhaps a product of psychology's
pretensions to science.  Feigning to be a science  has led to a scientistic
presumption of the "mystery" of mind only "truly knowable" by experts and the
methods of experts.  This scientism has led to an anti-epistemology in his
eschewing and utter disregard for the philosophical examination of his
foundational concepts.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recommended that psychologists think along with philosophers <U>about</U>
the nature of theory and its socio-political embeddedness instead of merely
thinking <U>through</U> the lenses of theories.  It is also recommended that
psychologists think <U>about</U> evidence and data rather than unquestioningly
raising it to such stature that we are only influenced by it.  Leveling the
stature of theory and evidence while acknowledging our own social embeddedness
as psychologists can only serve to give a fresh, more egalitarian and less
contentious relationship between the many constituencies of psychology as a
discipline and psychologists as professionals.    </div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one argues along with Foucault that <U>all</U> characterizations are
necessarily embedded within a social nexus of norms, purposes, power, etc.,
then how does one argue that one reality (e.g., that of the political power
nexus of the clinical psychologists, or that of the sterile explanatory world
of the scientific psychologist) is necessarily more counterfeit than another? 
How can one select one over another as "better"?  Or how can we make one
reality the slave to the other?  Turning to Wittgenstein, we are reminded that
ultimately meaning is consensual--the meaning of a concept is what a language-using community gives it.  Whether it rests in a power nexus or not,
understanding a concept is a matter of being able to identify exemplars of the
concept.  Meanings evolve and change with the evolution of a language-using
group, group membership, with the evolution of a concept as it is understood
by a group.  Nothing is inherently wrong with circularity in meaning.  All
meaning ultimately results in an infinite regress of words.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the person of the clinical psychologist or psychoanalyst, we have the
sort of professional who must, for the sake of understanding, be at least
tacitly hermeneutically sensitive.  Interacting with a client, it is this
professional who has the willingness to understand and to find meaning in
human action on its own terms, by acknowledging her/his own social
embeddedness and the impossibility of divorcing oneself from one's own social
and linguistic history.  As such, the most fertile ground for the
investigative psychologist to have and to create insight is in the
narrative/discursive understanding of the social, moral, political rather than
in the usual pretensions to objectivity.  Such posturing does <U>not</U> necessarily
lead to nihilism, but does precisely the opposite: it re-embraces the
meaningfulness inherent in human action as understood in a social, dialogical
milieu.  Further, we believe "expertise" ought not be defined in terms of
scientific or clinical methods or the imposition thereof but a commitment to:</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)  the assumption ("faith" of Gadamer) that there is
meaning/understanding to be had as one sharing in community,</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)  affirmation (Gadamer's "good will")  toward the person in however
one presents oneself, and</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)  perseverance in the dogged pursuit of understanding the individual
or individual's relationship to groups with the ultimate criterion for
understanding residing in the social milieu.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would encourage that, like a clinical psychologist or psychoanalyst, we get
to know our subject's <U>qualities</U> before interpreting their behavior or their
being quantitatively.</div><br>

<div id="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a hierarchy of "goodness" of explanation or expertise, then the
value of the expertise of psychology becomes one of enlightenment or expanded
consciousness, or insight via <U>change</U> of characterizations.  Again, along with
Wittgenstein, <U>if</U> the language-using collective agrees that a particular
conception is more useful or characterizes better (for its purposes) than
another, then such a conceptualization process has been of value.  Its value
<U>cannot</U> depend upon superordinate criteria for truth.</div><br>
